Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,ovylMjgecjY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovylMjgecjY,"most contract. Uh just give us your reaction to the fact that you're going to be working with Mo for another two years at least. Happy of course. Um um he's he's he's shown at this club for so many years in a row now how much of uh value we ask for the team for the club. So uh as like I assume all our fans and his teammates, we're very happy that he extended for two more years. and uh hopefully um yeah he can show Sunday again how important he has been for the whole season to us. Is the relief as well? Uh I think for the fans it is I don't think it's a surprise to you that I knew a bit better how uh his contract situation went over the course of the whole season. So um maybe for the fans it was a pleasant surprise. I knew it a bit longer of course that things were heading in the right direction and I think it's also a big compliment for Richard that he achieved to extend um MoSalah who such a great player on as as a free agent can go probably to every club in the world wherever he wants to but um he stayed at our club and that's um that's also a compliment for Richard I think I'm assuming then you know more than us as to where Virgil Van Dag's contract situation is at at the moment. So, how close are you to announcing a new deal for Virgil? And I suppose how does his position regarding his future contrast with that of Trent Alexander Arnold at the moment? I think you know the answer uh the boring answer as always. Uh we talk about contracts if they are signed. So in the situation with Mo, we are talking about it. As long as they're not signed, we don't talk about it. But I can I can tell you that I'm very happy with Fil this season. He's been incredibly for us. uh uh even the last few games where maybe there were moments um where he could do better, but if you look at at at at the other 89 minutes, he's such an important player for us. So, um so yeah, let's hope he can do the same what I just hoped for with Mo, he can do the same on Sunday as well, being uh being our leader again, as he's always been this season against West Ham. He did drop that hint last week though that it's getting close agreement. I don't read all the things that are that are told any right but I mean it's good news as well in some ways this I suppose has been the most difficult point in the season for you losing against Fulham and and going back to those defeats to to PSG and Newcastle as well but the last time you lost to the league of course you then went and won eight on the bounce in all competitions so that would obviously see you home in the title race were you to do that now that would be nice if that happens again indeed Uh I think uh talking about present man this this week probably brought our home game in a different perspective if um if people were not aware yet of how good of a team they are they've probably are aware of that even more uh after seeing them play against Aston Villa and if you then look back at our home game where in my opinion in my opinion uh we were over 90 minutes the better team then uh we might might might have a bit more credits about a performance than we got back then. Uh but uh indeed losing against Fulham is not what we wanted. Um but no matter if you win a game or you lose a game of football, if you play at home at Anfield, um players need know that they have to show up and um and that's what we're going to do on Sunday. Anna, working with Prem during your time here and and being up close to him, what is it that makes him so special and why is it that obviously fans and the club and everyone connected here are so pleased today that this player is staying with you? First of all, um he's always been judged as a player. He's always judged as a player, which is of course what you guys should do, but I also see him as a human being and he's a humble person. always wants to work hard, always uh puts a lot a lot of effort in to become the player he has become and he wants to stay at that level. So, he just keeps on bringing that that effort every single day. And what makes him special on the pitch is in my opinion that um that he can score goals. Now, there are more players who can score goals, but Mo can also score a goal if he's not in in in in the best half hour or the best 15 minutes. Um and and that's why he's mentally so strong as well and and and you need to be that if you want to be seven or eight years at the highest level every 3 or 4 days apart from quality about from physique you need to be mentally really strong as well and I think that's apart from all the other things uh how mentally strong he is is is probably what stands out for me. How much of an input did you have on him staying? How much work did you do on keeping Mo here? Ah, I'm part of that process, but uh I don't think I deserve the compliments. I think it's first of all, it's Mo choice and his agent choice what he wants and second of all the club FSG, Richard, Michael Edwards, they put a lot of effort in him to extend and effort mostly means [Laughter] money but also effort not only money. Uh so I think um what what what what um what it might tell you as well that that it's not only uh a good season this season, we want to make a very good season next season as well. And I think Mo is convinced that there's a fair chance that that we're able to do so. So um again, that's that's positive for us with the full result and obviously some of the results that Vinnie alluded to a moment ago. Is this the exactly the sort of boost and the bit of a reset that everyone needs just to forget what's gone before and just look ahead at the challenge that you've got at these final matches to get yourselves over the line? I would prefer not to forget what has happened before because we're 11 points clear in one of the most difficult competitions uh there has been in the past 10 years. If you look at how many English teams are still in Europe, how well they are doing in Europe, Arsenal beating Real Madrid 3-0 and it could have been five or six. So that probably tells you how strong this competition is. And uh so please please please let our fans and our players not forget how fantastic we've we've done till now. We're out of the Champions League because we lost against Parisian J after one of the best games of football I've seen I've been part of in my life. Uh so um I would like us to remember what we've did. not the last game because that's the one we've lost, but in general we can look back at eight or nine months of of of of very good football. Um, we're in a season you always are a bit on a high and a bit on a low, but on average I think individual performance has been really well and team performance also. Thank you, Anna. What more can can Moalah bring to Liverpool? His record since the day he signed has been incredible. His numbers are fantastic. This season though, he's developed a new facet to his game in terms of the amount of assists and you get you're looking at a player that always appears to want to learn more and and and signing this new deal. Can it can it put an extra spring in his step, do you think? But what more can he do for you? Um, we're always trying to achieve a bit more as a team and as individuals, but if you are playing at Liverpool, probably you're also close to coming to to to the maximum of your ability. Um, so there's not a lot of room for improvement from Mo or for all the other players anymore, but you're just trying to reach perfection. And um, I saw Desambo saying this. That's the masters golf where we just spoke about before uh the press conference started. I saw a phrase of him and it was from Lombardi I think who said we're trying to re we are trying uh to reach perfection which we will never reach but we reach excellence on the way and I think that's uh what we are trying here as well. So, we're trying to bring the best and the maximum out of the players uh to find this one or two% extra, but it's clear that Mo is coming close to the end uh of not to the end of his career, but to the end of his ability. We've I think we've we've brought almost the maximum out of his qualities this season. And then it's about consistency, which is one of the most difficult things in football. And that's why he's been seen as such a star player because to play once or twice the way Mo does, I'm not saying everyone can, but most players can, but to do this on such a consistency level, that's what makes it so hard. And then I come back to the mentality part again. Defeats have been a rarity in the Premier League this season. Your first away defeat last week at Fulham. I know you were disappointed particularly in the first half with with the mistakes that were made defensively and you've also hinted at that when you analyze the Newcastle game. Do you learn sometimes more from what needs to be done when the players standards dip like that in terms of a reference point for what you need to do between now and the end of the season? Uh I think immediately after the game it felt to me that um we only made three mistakes maybe four because after five minutes IU lost the ball in his 18 yard box as well and that cost us three goals. Uh but in the moment I also already felt that it wasn't a bad performance in the first half which sounds weird if you make three mistakes but if you just keep the free mistakes out and you look at what we've did it wasn't our best performance but it wasn't bad as well. But as it is in football, if it would have been one nil up in that game, probably everybody say, ""Oh, Liverpool control the game. They do really well and you can see three goals with three mistakes and everybody says it's been the worst first half of the season of that we've ever seen at this football club."" That is where football is all about. It's all about you are judged on the goals, you score and you concede. Um so second half I liked a lot but unfortunately we could only score one goal. But uh the mentality that we've shown by being free one down and coming back in the way we did creating more than enough chances to get a result also shows me how much character we had. But I liked the second half also more than the first half because we were much more dynamic. So players run much more players took much more risks and um in the right places the risks uh and uh that led to a much better second half than the first half. And that's again where we try to learn from and do better on Sunday. Despite the effort and the money that you've spoken about, how much does this contract with Mo help your planning for the summer? Because you can use resources to build rather than replace. Yeah. And I think um if I would put myself in the shoes of a player that we might want to sign, it's always nice uh to tell them that Mo that we don't have to tell them anymore because it's out in the open now that uh Mo has extended his contract. So So that helps. But what helps the most is that we kept a quality player that scored seven or eight years in a row so many goals for us. And um in the end I just said football is a game we are mostly judged on the goals we score and we don't concede. Uh uh so it's helpful to have a player that can score goals. That's for sure. And it's not a question about contracts but forgive me it might be equally as boring. Um semi-automated offside comes in this weekend. What do you make of that and what do you make of it coming in at this stage of the season? For me, it's something positive because uh I think it even helps the officials to make a better decision. And uh it's also clearer to the fans because if I watch a game of football, it doesn't have to be mine or somewhere else around the world and I see a red line and a blue line, I'm always like that's close to each other. But when I see this this this 3D, is that the way you say this? Uh I'm like, oh yeah, it's indeed you're right. It's offside. Um, so it's uh I think it's a positive thing. Uh, and I like uh the VR for clear and obvious, not not clear for obvious things, not for subjective things. So I'm a big fan of using the VR only for your objective things. So offside, yes or no. Or ball over the line, yes or no. Is it inside or outside the box? I would prefer the subjective things to go out, but that's not going to happen. um just it's on Mo again. Sorry. Um how how how important the message does he send both inside and outside the club that he has signed for two years? Uh like I just said, I think it's important because I I I'm I'm 100% sure that our fans uh uh love to see him extending. So it gives a positive five toward the club. Maybe a positive five we might even not need, but it's always good to have positive vibes instead of negative vibes. On the other hand, Mo performed so well, the club performed so well with you guys only talking about their contracts. Um but uh I think it's only positive because if you want to sign new players or players that want to extend here, yes or no, it's always positive to see that one of our one of our star players over the last seven or eight years uh have made the choice to extend his contract. So and it also shows maybe um the the uh how ambitious this club is. Uh uh so not only Mo but also the owners and um and the ones that came in last season that we are really ambitious to um to keep performing the way this is club has performed for so many years now. You spoke about him reaching the end of his his talent you know the top of the level. Has he has his his role changed for you this season? And do you see him having to adapt as he gets older or you because this may be some games where he's maybe not been involved as much as maybe had been in the past, but he's still producing the numbers. So, have you changed his role or do you see his role changing? Yeah, that I don't know. I don't know if he was uh in in in six, seven or eight years ago or or maybe three or four years ago if he was every second of the game involved. I would be surprised if I look at all the wingers all around the world. They are not 90 minutes uh uh uh outplaying their opponent every single time. I think if you are a winger, you have to be creative and that's the most difficult part in football, especially against these low blocks uh many good finger wingers face. So then it's normal that once in a while you lose the ball or one of your action actions fail. But in general, Mo has a lot of impact on our game with assist and goals. But not only that, I think he's al also a big threat. But he's not the only one. If I look at the Champions League this week, I think um wingers are getting more and more and more and more important in this modern game of football because uh teams are going to lower lower lower lower blocks than ever before. Uh and then if you like if you look at Vafina Lamales do a uh now Matinelli they were all able during the week to open up um to open up uh the last line or to open up to create chances and that's what Mo does for us and what Cody and Lucho are doing for us as well. Hi Anna, you mentioned Ibu Canate before and we've spoken previously this season about his abilities on the ball and the improvements that he's made in that area against Fulham. He was substituted for an attacker. That's the fourth time that this has happened this season. What does he still have to do to become an asset in those times when you are chasing the goal rather than being sacrificed? Now, for me, um, if I take him out for another center back, that probably tell if I that probably tells you that I wasn't as happy about his game. Or if I take Virgil out and I bring another center back in, you could assume that I he's either injured or he's not fit or I'm not so happy with the way he's playing. If I bring an attacker in or a midfielder in, that probably tells you that we want to take a bit more risks and that is what has happened. So, uh, I think Ibu improved uh, during this season on the ball. It's not that he was really worse. So he was a French international that played the World Cup final. So uh he was already good player. I don't think maybe he on his own improved. He knows better what we as a team want, how do we want to do build up, where his teammates should be and which choices he has to make in that regard. uh but to take him off and I think I've brought I don't know anymore who I who did I bring probably I think it was no no I brought Kza in for Robertson but um Darwin I brought Darwin in and another doesn't matter but it was for sure a player that probably can can score a goal a bit more easy than Ibu can um so taking him off at Fulham has nothing to do where he is in his stage of how well he does with the ball that simply, yeah, we are free two down. Let's bring as much goals on the pitch as we can. Let's take as much risks as we can to hopefully get a goal and um I think we created quite a lot uh afterwards, which not to say which we haven't would not know if he was still on the pitch, but um it did work out in terms of chance creation, not in terms of scoring. Hang on. You've always been very relaxed about the contract situations this season. Were you always calm that you would find a solution long term to Mo and that he would extend and see his stay with the club? I think in general people see me as quite relaxed except for maybe seven or eight minutes during this season in a certain away game Finny. Um and that has all to do with the the the tr the trust I have in equality of my players. And this is all to do in the in the in the trust I have in the quality of leadership FSG, Michael Edwards and and Rich Jud. So um there is that's why I'm uh indeed calm about the whole situation because um they they they will they will do what is best for the club and if that is extending that is extending and if not then they will find good solutions again because that's what they've showed for so many years now. So, um there's a reason for me to be calm about everything, but of course, I also uh I've also spoken to Mo and and and I followed the whole process and that gave me a lot of confidence as well about his situation. You've obviously got one of the three contracts sorted now. Do you think it's important that these the other two obviously trends? I know you won't discuss what is the latest, but is it important we get those contract issues sorted in the next couple of weeks, do you think, or before the end of the season? That last thing would be useful because he's not sorted before the 1st of uh July, I think. Then uh no, but you know my answer. Um we will see what's going to happen in the upcoming weeks and there's not a long long time to go anymore. So you will get your answers between you and now and two months I think. And um first of all I think it should go about us being happy that Mo has extended and it should not be the talks about other players. James just in terms of Sunday is Allison fully recovered though? Yes he is. And and um one of the positives last week was obviously Connor Bradley is cameo with the four weeks training. Does that put him in contention to to maybe start Sunday? Yes he does. How how much of a boost is that to have him back around Conor obviously been out for a long time? Uh, of course it's a boost. It's always a boost when quality players come back, especially quality players in that position because I think Curtis Jones is a quality player, but it's not his favorite position. So to have a player in his favorite position is always uh uh uh not always, but it might be better for the team. And Connor has done so well for us this season, just like Trent. But when Trent then isn't there, you always look to hope behind you and see that Connor is available. But then if he isn't, then we have to solve that problem. And we're not the only team in this league uh that that has had these problems. So um we've tried to bring the best out of it. That worked really well against Everton. I think Curtis played well also against uh Fulham. Uh of course he was involved in the goal, but yeah, you you can you can ask yourself the question if he could do so much about that. Um but um he did it quite well to very well in my opinion for two times but now to have Connor back I think we all would make the same decision and um that's playing Connor in that position quickly. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you."
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,cvTnGrKsagY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvTnGrKsagY,well good uh Anor first of all Virgil said after Tuesday night that he still doesn't know what's happening next season when do you need to know when do you want to know what's happening with those three players and who's staying who's going uh I don't know what's happening next season as well uh in terms of results but that's not what you mean um the only thing I know is that I want Virgil to be here next season and all the rest is um is talks about contract and that's not what I do over here is it impacting planning at all for next season oh interesting way of asking things uh no it doesn't not for me no looking ahead to this weekend though Squad wise I'm guessing Trent probably out canate though is he fit uh and therefore at right back as well is it a straight choice between jel maybe Endo could play there yeah I think maybe even Curtis can play there but um and you can also play with a left footed uh uh defender on the right side which is what Newcastle doing at the moment but then on the opposite so Trent is indeed not available uh he will not be there at the final but uh he's still to be assessed for how long it's going to take but we do expect him back in the end of the season um and what about uh IBU Kate we didn't train yesterday we were a day off and the day before was recovery so I I expect him to train with us today but let's see how he is obviously it's the chance for you to deliver your first trophy the first opportunity as well what would that mean to you to get the job done now particularly as a response to the disappointment of Tuesday night as well oh not about the last thing uh that has nothing to do with uh with with that if we if we win or lose the final in both situations will be a disappointment that we lost against the Parisian J we're out of that tournament but um you play games like this like a p like against par and J and like against Newcastle now to win it and uh that's also what we're going trying to do and we're really looking forward to it to playing a final again uh because you cannot take a final for granted uh especially not in this country with so many good teams involved in every cup competition so uh we're looking forward that we are part of it and if you are part of it of course you want and try to win it but that's uh probably what Newcastle wants as well thank you hi honor um the players or a lot of players in the squad have had their ups and downs over the years um is it easy for them because of that experience to pick themselves up to go into a final or do you need a little bit of you know do you need to kind of put their arm around and say you know let's go again kind of thing no that is the good thing about where we are in the league and the good thing about where we are now in the league cup so that is a final everybody likes to play a final wants to play a final that's why one of the reasons why we go out of bed every morning and come come here to train because you want to win trophies and this is a chance to win a trophy so we're looking forward to that and our league position is of course also reason for us to keep on going I've said it before if you have to leave the tournament I prefer to go out in the manner we did against panand and in the manner we did it against Plymouth so um I couldn't have asked for more for the players their intensity levels were the highest they've been this season I think the way we we started the game we we forced them to so so so many mistake we created a few very good chances which we normally usually score um and um yeah I also like the game because it was pure about pure football what it was about so um I've I've I've seen so many games recently and during my life where it's all about time delaying and and and Dives and pretending to be injured and then continue this was two teams wanted to go all in attacking wise and pressing wise without any thing to add just pure football and um again big compliment for p and that they were able to beat uh such a strong Liverpool team some of the players look physically tired on Tuesday later on in the game have you got any worries over the physicality of it all but you know the LI players have gone through lots of extra times in these finals before as well so if you got no worries about that if he does go into ex to I think it's in in the end quite normal that the players are are tired uh in extra time um especially if the 90 minutes were so intense so and you don't get the reward for that but I think I changed I made five changes so five of the 11 that were on the pitch and you can exclude the goalkeeper so five out of 10 could never be tired so I don't think that was the reason why um why P was better in the last half hour than uh than in the first 90 that had in my opinion nothing to do with us being tired but uh the players are able there are four days in between to play uh to play somay again definitely jerell's have a little bit of an up and down season for him I suppose but when when he's come on for you and done a job but right back he's he seems to have adapted quite well and and now he's got he's got England call up Senor call up what what does that say about sort of his attitude and the way he's applied himself uh it says a lot about his mentality uh so last season I think everybody saw what a talent he is uh then the season started with him starting and and and and I changed him as we all know against hip switch and IBU and Virgil were were and are such a strong combination that he didn't play a lot but every time he had to play except maybe for the first one or two games but afterwards every time he had to play you everybody could see that maybe he's not longer a talent because as a talent you don't have any setbacks but moment you get setbacks it's about you how you react and and I think he showed in his recent performances that he outgrow being called a talent uh and that's probably what Thomas tuul saw and sees as well by calling him up um by giving him a call up I think that's better to say uh and he did really well uh in the last few times he had to play for us uh and um even on a position he's not completely used to as a right fback but in my opinion he has also the qualities to play in that possession he's strong he's far he's very comfortable with the ball uh and it gives us an extra quality if we play him which we saw uh in terms of set pieces because he was the one that was this far away of us qualifying for the next round by heading the ball on the post because that one was not off Sid so yeah he um he showed mentality and that he had quality that's already what we knew when we saw him playing last season and he's he spoken the season about speaking to you about that decision IPS which which could have sent him you know one way or the other because you take up the half time you come under a lot of scrutiny but um I guess the fact that say he's he's recovered recovered from that but you know but got over that and and and and sort of settled down and and buckle down and try to sort of do the best he can after sort of what could be considered a setback first game of the season yeah yeah although if if if being substituted at halftime is a setback then almost every player has more than a few setbacks during his career I think it was more uh that people were a bit like the way what I said after the game that people were not used to uh maybe a manager or me being so uh clear about what I saw and what I did and that in the end probably went to a situation that um that he got criticized more than was normal for a player that was taken off at half time and again it's so good to see that he managed his way back into it uh um now already before in before the winter break he already had a few good moments as well and every time we now need him he uh he does really well so I think mentality wise it might might might have been a a good or a big moment for him that IPS Rich came because now he experienced that people were not only positive about about him like last season although he made one or two mistakes back then as well he also know knows now he can fight his way back if people all of a sudden are not as positive anymore and that is something I think every player should uh should experience in in the start of his career because a football career is never only going up it's always going a bit like this and now he knows he can fight back also after a situation he experienced at at at I Swit or after the I switch game um how is darwi NES and have you had to speak to individually to try and pick him up after Tuesday because of the penalty Miss he looked really he took like it looked like he took the disappointment of the penalty Miss quite hard yeah but I assume Curtis felt the same uh I think every player that need that that takes a penalty and misses it doesn't feel well but it's not only the two who missed it all the others uh uh didn't feel very positive as well after the game because we lost the game of football and they took the responsibility and in football you can miss a chance and you can miss a penalty and that is what can happen if you take the responsibility of taking a penalty um for me um uh I think we were closer to winning the game in the first 90 minutes and then uh penalties is always yeah in my opinion you need a bit of luck but there are many people who say no you can influence that luck which is also true uh because the more you train uh the better you do but these players do train their penalties on a regular basis as well but um he missed and that's that's that's not what you want but I don't want to make anything more out of it than just missing a penalty you've spoken about not having as much time as You' like on the training pitch particularly at this time of the season um how much has that hampered the ability for those who maybe not played as much as they like to kind of force their way into plans and thinking of obviously Harve has been able to get into some minutes recently but I think of someone like as well if you're not on the training pit how much opportunity does he get to impress you and maybe for his way into your plans yeah that's of course more difficult because these players hardly train with the starters if you look at our schedule on the last three or four months so uh if we play for example on Saturday and then we play on Tuesday again then on Sunday the ones that have played on Saturday uh they only do recovery session so they're not on the pitch and then it's a day before the game and it's maybe 10 15 minutes of tactics where it's more walking football than uh than playing football so there's hardly ever a moment where they can compete with each other but the day after the game I'm always outside my assistance managers have great exercises and the players always show themselves in these moments so those are moments to show where you are if you've improved yes or no and if you come closer to the players that are starting and of course when they come in but I agree with you the that um for the ones that don't start it's uh it's not an ideal world that we have so many games and that's completely true yeah what Newcastle tomorrow into people know just on that I mean there's been a lot of talk going into the final Newcastle haven't won a domestic trophy for 17 years and it this perception it's a bigger game for them than it is for Liverpool but I take it you wouldn't go along with that no I don't go along with that no final uh in this country is always special because of the fact there are so many strong teams in um in this country in this league uh so if you reach a final it's always a big moment for them but definitely also for us um because in the end although we've got two Cup games in this country but you can never take a final for granted and it's not like this yeah for Liverpool it happened last season but um we don't play every single season every final um so it is special for them but definitely also for us just in ter Newcastle they've lost the left sides T to L go and and you've OB lost J Alexander arold how you think that will affect the balance of the game potentially I said it uh one or two days ago in interview as well I think in this part of the Season especially in England it's almost impossible to have all your players fit and I think both teams have maybe two three or four players that are not uh uh that cannot play and that's almost a privilege because so many teams uh have had during the season more than two or three injuries two or three injuries is probably the minimum you can expect in a league like this after four months of non-stop football so it's a big compliment to the staff of Newcastle and our staff that so many players are available and yes Trent is a very important player for us and yes Anthony Gordon is a very important player for them but the good thing for both managers is that there are still a lot of quality players available for both managers
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,hhEBiZRlOAU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhEBiZRlOAU,and how far away do you feel you are from your sharpest and and your best levels now uh hello everyone um yeah it's been a difficult season for me personally um I had a few complications uh throughout the season uh obviously these month uh this last couple of months are the ones that matter the most where you decide things and uh I don't feel I'm on my best form at the moment but certainly by playing I will get there and um yeah always try to do my best no matter what yeah how far away do you feel you are what do you feel you need to take that step that gets you to to your best level uh you never know that's football uh I don't play alone uh this not an um individual sport so there's a lot of things that a lot of um things that you can't control yourself but one thing you can that uh to give your best and like I said that's always what I do on a pitch also saying Mo on course for possibly the greatest individual season in in the Premier League what do you make of the number he's again racked up this season it's it's outstanding um I I think at the moment people almost stop counting because it's like yeah it's just doing incredible things and in the end we'll just see the the final numbers because uh like you said it's for sure the the player I played at least with the the biggest season um and it's like the difference is so big that it's like let's see the final numbers obviously that helped us a lot um because we know we can rely on him to to do a lot of things create chances it is scoring or assisting and yeah obviously it's good to have a player like that in the team and you one n up in this tie you've got a cup final at the end of the week as well and your 16 points clear in the title race how much are you thinking about the possibility of delivering multiple trophies this season no it's a big week it's a big week uh we knew that before Southampton game was massive because it's the only game we played this month for the Premier League so we did our job there and now two more games in this week for two different competitions one it's decisive I think two are decisive but one it's the trophy on in the line already so yeah uh one game at the time it's tomorrow it's a big big game and we obviously want to go through and and obviously on the weekend to to win the first trophy but like I said one game at the time next one jul Mike hey dear go um you had to be very patient in that first leg yourself and and you're a player that just wants to get the ball and put it in the back of the net when you you're facing that type of opposition in PSG what's that like when you have to stay patient and do you expect that in this leg Yeah I think uh they they had the ball more than we expected they dominated the game in a way they created chances and obviously we were too far away from from their goal a lot of the a lot of the time but in the end we won the game so we are um we know that obviously tomorrow here with our fans we want to show a different face and the game will be different for sure uh but in the end we just want to go through l i Diego do you think that game last week was the toughest of the season for yourself and Liverpool in general uh yes I think so at least in my opinion I I obviously missed some games of the of the season but I think the way the game went was not the plan let's say I think that show us as well that even though the things were not going out well the way we could work hard and um stay in the game to eventually take our opportunity like we did means a lot as well and uh shows that the character these players have and that is also a very positive uh to take into to the reminder of the Season M hi Diego uh tomorrow actually marks four years since your last goal in the Champions League and obviously last season four years exactly yeah obviously you did well in the Europa League last season but um I was going to ask you are you aware of this but it SS like you weren't aware of how determined are you to be able to make a mark in this Elite competition uh let it be four years then um I think uh stats are also um a part of today's game especially but they don't they don't say everything but well I want to score obviously but that's not a factor that will uh impact my my game at all tomorrow and yeah if I don't score it we go through I I don't mind keep adding a few a few more days into it Caro you said you you're not at your best form at this moment when would you say was the last time you were at your best form because obviously injuries have played a big part in in the last few years really um I don't know um obviously sometimes you can have bad games sometimes you can also have good games when you that the form that you're talking about is like when you have a certain amount of games I think in the end as long as you keep being useful to the team and that's the most important and sometimes not only the stats but the way you can connect to your teammates and the way you can help the team defensively and how can you uh in the end uh help the team getting the win I think that's what I try to do um every time I'm on the pitch but obviously as a striker I want to get involved in scoring goals creating creating those opportunities and every game it's a new opportunity to do that anym no thank you everyone yeah thank you thank you Amy first couple of Honor Lis Enrique has just said that he thinks whoever wins this tie will go on to the final but he's also said in the last few days as well that PSG have nothing to lose coming here so how do you see it um I think after this game is still a long way to go to the final and um we already know which which teams we can face and I know from playing uh okay there's first Aston Villa or club brou and then afterwards is probably going to be Arsenal or uh Atletico Madrid so all very good teams but what I do agree with Luis Enrique that we are a team P and J are a team and three or four daughters that are good enough to reach the final but because it's so only two games luck and bad luck can be decisive as well uh so uh it's difficult to say but but both teams are good enough to reach the final let's put it that way and do you really think that they have nothing to lose or is that a bit of Mind Games uh they have a game of football to lose um uh and and we as well so um I do think both uh they've been in this stage of the tournament for many years now I think last year they reached the semi-final we were not even at this stage last season in the Champions League and the season before this this was the round where we were knocked out so yeah uh these teams normally are going quite far into into Europe and um yeah yeah that's it if you are to see it through what difference do you need to see from the first lag um I wasn't surprised at all about their performance uh they've impressed me a lot uh before we played that game I watched many games of them because we had a bit more time than normally and I was really impressed by the intensity they play at the the team cohesion uh the rotations in the Midfield it was a they are such a complete team such a well-managed team and I think we've experienced this um this last Wednesday um some people said we played poor I don't agree uh I played I think they played tremendously well uh I don't think we faced this season the team that combined that much quality with that much intensity but I do think we can do better so I'm not saying we played poor or not good at all but we are a better team than we are than we were last week and that's something we have to prove tomorrow with the help of our fans and two questions really there was there was some suggestion that PS G were surprised at the level of Liverpool last week in terms of that you weren't very good do you have any comments on that and do you think you'll have to play the best game of the season to get through tomorrow no I think what what you mean is that some of them have said that Arsenal and Bayern Munich were better uh than us and um I yeah that's that's I think what I've heard I think what that has to do with the fact that parisan J improved a lot in these two or three months and that they play away at Arsenal and away at Bayern Munich in these two games uh and I saw both of those games I just said I watched a lot of games I saw those too as well and they've they've they've improved and they've changed so at Arsenal away they were much lower waiting much more and now they just press all over the pitch and take the risk of One V one constantly uh um so they've improved they've changed and um yeah it's up to them uh how they felt I cannot uh um I cannot influence what they felt and I don't even know if it's true or not but um I hoping I'm hoping that they have a different opinion after tomorrow night perform yeah yeah yeah I do think so because this is the most complete team we've faced so far and what I mean with complete is okay we've faced of course Arsenal and City and it's not that there are big margins but uh the intensity they play that with combined with the quality they have because yeah let's be honest we are talking here about probably the Richard club or maybe there's one richer club uh a bit further Ahad but uh uh so they have so much quality uh and a great great great manager uh because he lets the team play in a way that it's not easy to play against this team and he brings the best out of every player and he brings incredible work rate in the team so that's why I think we have to be at our best tomorrow but for example we we didn't have ball possession at all City away the other richest Club richest club in the world together with Parisian German and at home we had uh a completely different performance against city than we had away J behind Paul and I just want just follow up to that do you think the players get extra motivation when they hear comments that maybe the the opposition doesn't think they're as good as they thought so I don't know uh I don't think anyone needs motivation not their players not our players if you play at anfield in a knockout stage with two of the better teams in Europe I think there are three four or five incredible teams in Europe at the moment uh and P is one of them and we are one of them so I don't think anyone needs any kind of motivation not our fans not our players not their players not the staff we're all looking forward to a game like this and everyone wants to be at their best if you play the best CH the hi Dar from K TV Mexico would you say that this match is the most important of the seasion for you yeah because it's the next one right because it's the next one and the next one is always the most important one jul hey you obviously you know got the title race going on you've got this game in the second leg your first knockout one here at anfield as well in the Champions League you've got a cup F at the weekend is weeks like this they might bring pressure but is this why you wanted to be Liverpool manager uh not particularly because of this week there are many reasons why I wanted to be the Liverpool manager first of all uh because the history of this club second of all the quality of the players I work with and third of all because you would expect us to be in these kind of moments in a season uh for Liverpool so uh you want to compete for every Trophy and when you join this club you expect to do so uh so yeah it's a nice part of the Season doesn't give us extra pressure because at this club if you're a player or a manager you know there's pressure every single day uh and that's also what we like otherwise we wouldn't be in this uh in this environment now hi Anor uh Lou Enrique said that his team need the ball in order to execute their game plan and retaining possession was probably one of the areas Liverpool could improve from the first leg how much is the ability to regain and retain possession going to factor into your game plan and maybe even team selection for this game tomorrow of course we're hoping that we will will have more of the ball than we had last week but again uh if you saw them playing uh they are very intense when they don't have the ball uh which led to them creating a few chances as well because they took the ball away from us when we had buildup and that led to a few chances but in the 87th minute uh when the ball was at Allison they moved forward with a lot of players we played it long and they were open where we could score our goal and I when I watched the game back I saw many moments that if a few of our players would have done better then that could have led to us creating chances I also know from my experience because normally my team is doing what is doing that every other man is always says yeah we could have done better in these transition moments but the thing is they did exhaust us a bit uh more than I wanted uh with them constantly pressing us pressing us yeah if you then get the ball uh sometimes you're a bit too tired to make the perfect execution and that's why it would be useful for us to have a bit the ball a bit more and um and and if we have the ball a bit more hopefully the game opens up also a bit more for us um we know we can do better than last week but I don't agree with people that said that we had a poor performance because I I I do feel that you don't give the right credits to the team that deserves those credits and that's what p man deserved last week they were incredible last week CH at the end the hello AR sport um 10 years ago you were assistant manager at K leard and 10 years ago Luis Enrique won the Champions League it's quite a difference how do you look at Luis Enrique and is there anything you taught at com is still something that you use today oh probably yes uh some exercises we do uh are still the same than 10 years ago but in football football evolves so as a manager need to evolve as well um I've I've enjoyed watching the Lis Enrique team of Barcelona and I'm enjoying watching it if they don't play against us again as well so uh actually quite quite similar so back then he had Chavi and inesta now he has F and Jo nees also not the biggest ones but so first St so quick and lightning fast players up front uh and fullbacks that likes to attack so so um maybe the biggest difference between his Barcelona team and this team is that they even rotate more so uh they were a bit more fixed in positions Back Then and Now their Midfield is just keep on rotating and keep on running makes it even more difficult team uh to play Maybe are you the same as you during your time at kumur sorry are you the same like as a person compared to your time at kumur I hope so I hope so as a person I'm a manager I hope I improved a bit but I hope I'm still the same person as I was back then yeah and I think I think it's it is like this yeah Carl this is the first time you've had a a lead to defend um is it do you see it that way is it a lead to defend or is what balance is it between defending and still attacking in terms of the approach you have to take yeah it's also only the second time we are facing uh two games so is there a difference no we try to play every game try to win that's also what we tried to do last week it wasn't our intention to be so low all the time uh we wanted to have a different game than we played over there but sometimes the other team with the help of their fans or their yeah it it we both saw what happen so tomorrow we want to play a different game but our intentions are always the same we're not going to go for a draw or we just want to win every single game and we want to have the ball as much as we can uh at City away that wasn't uh the situation at p man that wasn't the situation we do take Confidence from our home game against City where we did had the ball much more and it was much more of an equal game than it was the away game at city and of course everybody is writing about 27 shots and that's also what I saw but if you put all 27 shots in a row it's not that all 27 were amazing saves of Allison uh he had two or three incredible saves but most of their shots were from outside 18 Yard Box last couple Le then the gentan the green jumper hi honor you're a very calm man most of the time anyway um and always talking about the next game next game but in a week like this you must allow yourself to dream a little bit about you know getting to the final of this competition or lifting trophies do know in a week like this you don't dream at all you just know you have to work really really really hard to to prepare the team in the best possible way that's what I try to do for every single game but if you had a game like like we had last week you feel like can I even go to sleep or do I have to watch even more um so no I don't dream at all at the moment about uh about this week we are just very focused on what we need to do tomorrow and the week started off um in terms of a result really well on Saturday beating Southampton and now we're looking forward to tomorrow because I think everyone looks forward to to a game of football like this uh at anfield two great teams playing against each other and just quickly is Cody fit to be in the squad tomorrow yeah he will be in the squad yeah he trained today for the first time yeah last one here hi coach xav M from Radio France you told us that uh you be impressed by this PSG even you scored a goal at the first game um do you think it's 50/50 tomorrow yeah maybe I do yeah yeah um the result was ours the performance was for them uh I think both teams have showed in the last 15 20 25 games that they can score goals from everywhere so um yes we are one nil up but uh and and and that gives us confidence where it will give give them confidence the way they've played uh their performance so yeah maybe 50/50 is uh is is is a fair way of looking at it yeah thank you thank you you're welcome
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,tDTrKObNcW0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDTrKObNcW0,a game of two halves what was your message to the players at half time and what was you thinking and you know were you Cal are you angry how were you that I didn't give them compliments at the halftime I can tell you um sh maybe it was because I was sitting up there instead of being uh at the line because I know from experience not that I've been suspended before but yeah in in England I was but uh uh that when you watch a game over there you always feel like ah maybe I can even play in this game but if you're then at the line it's always more Tempo but uh I don't think I was wrong this time if I said at halim that energy levels were far far far too low and uh that is what had to change and that's uh why we made free substitutions just to apart from bringing in quality also create something because nine out of 10 times when you take three out the other eight are like o something else uh should happen and that's the only thing I could come up with at halftime to um to create something different for the second half in the end I took him off because he was on yellow um but I always hate the idea we need to score goals that to take someone off that can score a goal uh so um that's why it wasn't in my mind and to take him off because I was already planning on after these three if we don't score a goal then jot needs to come in and we have to go even more offensive um um so uh with Cody being out it isn't like we have that many attacking options left so that's why uh I took a certain risk of keeping him a number nine that is on yellow is a difference than Costa so I took Costa out for that reason because he was on yellow uh and second of all of course I also knew that Robo always creates something with his energy with his uh mentality not only in the team but also with the fans and yeah there's a reason why Makai is a World Cup winner because he always shows up when you need him in terms of mentality and that's also definitely what he brought in this in the second half yeah yeah but that's also the life of a number nine you go from missing a chance to scoring an important goal to then all of a sudden missing a chance again but uh I think uh today uh especially in the second half you also saw the work rate he came bring to the team and um yeah but the main thing that happened was in the second half that we we started to play in a different Tempo not only without the ball but also with the ball so I think the first goal if you look at Lucho how he takes that one V one on I don't think I can select the clip where that happened in the first half not a lot and uh in the second clip uh uh the second goal Ryan pushed up all the way at the 18 yard line to win that ball which led to the foul on Darwin where in the first half every ball that fell out they could just pick up the ball and start to play and uh no uh the energy in the stadium for the players and by the fans was the second half completely different than the first half hi I'm from Hungary and for for newsite one question about Dominic uh they play a lot of games now what is the physical condition uh of uh you didn't select the right game because every time I'm sitting here I'm talking about Dominic I'm talking about he's a machine he just can't keep on going running running running but it was maybe the first time this season that I saw different energy from him which is maybe normal maybe I uh made a mistake by playing him because because he gives so much every single game now the good thing is he only played 45 so um so he's more rested for the upcoming week now than um than he is when I would have played him for 90 and the good thing for me is I have more than only one good midfielder in in in terms of Dominic we have quite a few you and Har he came in really strong and helped the team again after U him helping the team against B also on any concerns looking ahead to Tuesday and next week about the energy levels that you saw in the first half uh no because I know these players can can come up with completely different energy levels than they came up with today in the first half uh I think it was maybe the first time this season that I saw this Tempo maybe maybe it had to do with me sitting up or did you do you agree with me that the first half was okay then I saw it correctly it had nothing to do with me sitting over um so uh if these people know anything about football do they yes yeah they do okay um what was the question oh yeah can they go yeah yeah no um I think par and showed us the right example uh they played liil in incredible intensity 40 up at halime and then they played against us and um that intensity I had haven't seen before in in a game we played this season so um yeah we have to not only uh apart so when when I look at the game against P we have to go one step up in terms of intensity if I compare it with the game today we need to go three four five six seven steps up in terms of intensity if you want to have any chance of reaching uh the next round one two three was it difficult decision not to start hary after hero they it's always a difficult decision not to start Harvey not to St start wat uh not to start all the other ones that I don't play um but if someone comes in five minutes he touches his first ball scores a goal and then uh change your hold the idea about all the lineups you made before that would be a bit um out of line or yeah you say differently that's you say differently but that would be a bit weird as well so yeah he had a good impact on the game today he had again a good impact on the game that's why he got 45 minutes today as well because he did so well in Paris um but there's also a reason why I play so many times the other ones and and all the time they deserved that trust but today if I could do it one more time over I would have started differently than I started today but uh yeah you don't know this in advance can you see Harvey Elliot doing enough to get into your starting 11 like his confidence today seemed off the probably after Wednesday yeah you see him doing enough to get in there will there be enough time for him yeah there's enough time we play nine more games in uh in the Premier League and hopefully a few more in the Champions League as well with one in the league cup so um what it is with him it is also with other players they are in competition with so many good players and uh that makes it sometimes difficult to make a lineup but it always helps to bring in performances in like this uh for him and but also wat he came in 50 minutes before the end and again he showed how important he is for this team and the and and the others as well so um he he trains really well he does this and that that's I said it many times about what I can say the same about javey hardly any playing CH but just keeps on going and then when your moment comes then you can show your your quality and that's the biggest compliment um I can give him but also the biggest com what he brings to the team is that he just kept on going because I've I've I've experienced more than enough players that if they are in the same situation like him a wat they start to do less and less and when you then play him you will probably not ask me why you don't play him and uh this is the situation we want as a team and it makes it sometimes difficult for me that's true just you been on the today or did you no no otherwise I would have taken him because this was the most important game of the week like I told you and the first of three finals so if he would have been able I would definitely had him on the bench but unfortunately it wasn't um but I do hope that the two next finals we play a bit better than the first one
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,ymmWPIm0K6s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymmWPIm0K6s,Virgil were in agreement on Wednesday night after the game that in well certainly in saying that Allison is the best goalkeeper in the world just tell us from your point of you what really sets him apart uh shaving shaving shaving shots it's probably one of the most important things a goalkeeper has to do no I think um uh to become the best goalkeeper in the world you have sometime you sometimes need to make saves that others wouldn't make and um I think he had one or two of them um when yeah Wednesday it was and um in general it was a bit exagerated talking about 27 shots he didn't have to make 27 saves uh but he had two world world world class saves in big moments for us because if you go one nil down then the game would even be harder than it already was being nil nil you've made a point a few times this season of saying that not often have you got more than you deserved I just wonder is Wednesday an example of that turning around a little bit and developing the opposite kind of habit which could be crucial now and maybe delivering three trophies uh that's a long question but uh I leave a little bit out I would say we weren't a little bit lucky we were really really really really lucky but as Michael Jordan said once the harder you work the more luck you have and this is the biggest compliment you have to give the players they've worked incredibly hard and I think even the second half we didn't control ball possession we were not do the dominant team at all but we controlled them better than in the first half and that also has to do with the players being able if you were 45 minutes the other team had the ball a lot you had to defend so much mentally so strong and physically so strong to come up with the second half performance with not giving away that many open chances as we did the first half and even scoring a goal on the Counterattack that shows you how mentally strong and phys strong these players are again though I mean we talk about situations like that there saying in English football that your name is on the cup when you have situations like that do you look at it like that and think that this is that mentality that ability to to get over the line when you haven't been necessarily your best performance of the Season how crucial is that when you're going for trophies on impr forence if you want to win something if it's the Premier League or the league cup or the Champions League or the EA cup you need to have once in a while a game where you don't play your best football and you are lucky which is maybe not lucky if you work as hard as we do to come get away with a result there are almost no teams that play 38 games or and the champions league is not as much only good football I think Real Madrid is one of the best examples of that they also find a way to win a game if the other team is better than them and that's what they did but I'm not looking at all at the Parian s game anymore more uh our full Focus my full focus is now on Southampton which is the first of three finals to be played in the upcoming week and therefore how much has Wednesday taken out of the players and how does it impact then team selection because obviously there is that second leg to come and then there is a cup final against Newcastle as well yeah but for me the one against Southampton is by far the most important not only because it's the first one we play uh but it is a very very important one for us so if if I make the choice to uh play other players that is because I think that's the biggest chance to win the game tomorrow and not because I want to rest them for the game uh against pan J so the only way uh I make a change is because maybe it's only two days uh in between uh and then I I might feel that playing someone else is a better option because we have many players that are of equal quality but that then only has to do with us getting a bigger chance of winning the game against Southampton then it has anything to do with the Parian Man game um what goes through your mind when you are deciding team selection because I know the old cliches it's one game at a time but in your mind do you actually probably know your lineup against PSG and the Cup Final do you do you think that far ahead no no no not not not as much as um as you might think uh uh of course you do know what to expect now from PRI you do know what to expect from Newcastle but for me the most important game is the one against Southampton and um if there would be three four five days in between these two this uh the last game and this one I would have probably started the same 11 again even if there was only two days in between for the next one um but since there's only two days in between and it was we had to fight really hard and it's not the first game uh after being three or four weeks out it's the probably the 50th game in in three months I don't know how many uh so you take that to into account but you take the quality from the team you face you take uh the form of the players you take how fit they are which players are best uh fit best together uh so if you look at we started off with with Lucho and Joo uh where where where Jugo is a type of player nine and a half for me almost he he's um he's almost a midfielder as a striker uh and then I finished the game with Curtis who's a midfielder from the left and Darwin who's more of a real nine so these combinations you look at depending on the opposition and uh and the and the formation of the other team the good thing for us is uh because you guys are till now only focused on P is that Southampton has the same uh uh formation if they have the ball as pan J has so now we need to do much better without the ball so to press uh press Southampton then we did against B sh so it's um it's another good test for us I think only um only notam Forest have used fewer players than Liverpool in the Premier League do you like having a kind of tight Squad like that or an ideal world for manager would you have a biggest one I see the advantages of playing mostly with the same team because uh they get used to each other so uh uh that helps but also am aware of the fact that you cannot play a season with 11 players so that's why you saw sometimes players rotating and I don't do this with 20 or 25 but mostly with 14 15 if possible and the other ones don't always get the playing time they deserve I think hareli is a great example of that he's done so well for this club uh he trains well but he's in competition with Mo Salah and Dominic soers and uh now I don't think Mo was happy that I took him off a five minutes before before the end if I looked at his body language um so and there's a reason for that because he is a player that can score a goal for us even if he's not even playing his best game uh so uh that's why I hardly take him off now I did and and Dominic so Li is yeah you could call him a machine every time you play him on the pitch he's uh he's the one that runs most and um that's what's it makes it sometimes hard for Harvey that's why I like it so much how he did when he came in only five minutes some players are sometimes frustrated if they only get five minutes but in our team it has never happened uh maybe once or twice uh but uh in general is never never happens Yeah you mentioned Mo's body language there I just wonder does the hunger of some of the more senior players in the squad make rotating and and making the substitutions difficult for you ah to be clear that is not the headline that Mo was frustrated I could see that he would have preferred me not to take him off but his his behavior was completely normal he shook hands he he just uh probably thought maybe there's one chance to come and I will score that one and to be fair to him he ever does he always does that so uh um people now say ah a good good substitution because hary scored I think if I asked him he would tell me if I would be there I would have scored the same ball as well uh so um he had a completely normal reaction uh but um uh not only the ones that that like like you probably mentioned like Mo and Virgil and the ones that won the league before I think all of them show Great Character till now this season and that's also what we need tomorrow again uh against Southampton because um they are not playing as a team that is bottom of the league they take a lot of risk they go man through man all over the pitch that's the same what pandas and they probably saw how difficult we had uh we had it over there with that came plan so I'm expecting the same for tomorrow it's another game where you'll be managing not on the touch line I just wonder from the game you played previously against Newcastle I know a lot of managers have spoken in the past that sometimes they get a good tactical view from up there they analyzed the game maybe a bit better they like to spend time both up there and down on the touch line just wondered what your view on that was and how you sort of saw the game last time yeah uh I think I have the same opinion the only difference between now and five 10 15 years ago is that we have all iPads and and and MacBooks on the on the sideline so we have the same view if I look at that screen so it's not necessary to take a suspension to have uh a great view um but um yeah the view is better but I always feel that if you're if you're at down the line or at the line uh you feel a bit more the emotions you feel be better uh the strength of both teams if players are tired yes or no then if you are up there the the game goes a bit slower uh where I'm sitting tomorrow it's easy game to play but if you are standing at the same level everybody would say o it's harder to play this game than I expected when I'm sitting uh so much higher so um it's not ideal but I said before with with John I think I I have a very good replacement he did so well at ax Amsterdam and he did really well in his first game in charge as well just go back to the goalkeeping situation Allison's been the long held number one here for such a long time you signed mad Das last summer to come next year is is it important to keep providing that competition for Alison to to keep getting the best out there I'm not saying we you not get the best out of him but with him being number one for so long and being almost unchallenged does does he need that competition to keep him at at highest level uh yes or no uh because he has great competition with G Keller now as well um so if if if if that is what drives him then maybe it helps him to have such a good number two behind him but I don't think he needs that he's just a top professional like all of the boys over here um and they know what it means to wear the shirts you have to bring in top performances uh otherwise you can't play uh for this club uh and you always know if you are here if you're a midfielder an attacker defender or the goalkeeper if you don't do well there's someone else that can do the job for you if it's sque we also have Fidos which is a very very very talented goalkeeper as well so uh goalkeeper wise we're in a good uh in in in a in a good how do you say this in a good good place yeah and you sort of twitched on this already before but um after the PSG game I guess you you have metrics you measure the physical exertion that players have but how do you assess sort of the the what's what's taken out of them mentally in terms of the pressure that were ring that game and how they dealt with it do you do you see that that that sometimes it affects them H that's difficult to measure but that's definitely something uh um that's something you also feel when you at the touch line um but and it's definitely something you take into account because uh you can only look at the data and probably then they've run just as much as some other games but there's a difference if you have 70% ball possession or you have only 30% ball possession that means the runs you have to make are more from a negative mindset if you if if you if they have the ball all the time it's not as nice as if you have the ball yourself so you do take that into account as well and and and of course three or four months without any break uh take you take these things in account as well but that's why of course uh I was not only happy uh with the with the goal half he scored because that gives us a good uh uh uh um uh how do you say this Advantage good Advantage for the second game but it's mentally helps of course a lot as well uh to score that goal so we're in a good place but like I said three finals to be played in a week uh again after this one with only two days in between uh so um yeah a week to look forward to for every Liverpool fan and I know if the final is there and everybody is already talking to me about uh uh how the atmos atere will be on the champions league night but I hope I hope I truly hope that our fans will be at as loudest tomorrow and not in the final and not against PSG but tomorrow is is that because because of the position of this game between those two ties it's almost like people take it for granted that Zack Anon bottom the league it should be easier for you but that's why that's where the danger lies in this time this mat yeah I have to convince my players uh that we play free finals like I said now a few times uh and I'm hoping and that's why I every time come up with the word final that I influence our fans a bit as well that they understand how important they going to be tomorrow so I'm hoping they will not uh come into the stadium five minutes before the kickoff I'm hoping they are already the whole stadium is already completely filled half an hour before kickoff and that these players get the reward for what they did at in Paris for working so hard so they have great songs sometimes when I look at social media I see these songs coming from Lucho and from Virgil and from Maka and they are really creative in these songs now let's hear them before the game tomorrow although I'm in the St but uh yeah maybe I can start with with uh Isaac Isaac is always uh this this little boy yeah maybe yeah thank you no uh firstly Anna I wanted to check on the stat of Cody gakpo how close he came to midweek and is he available for this game at the weekend he didn't train yesterday yet so let's see if he can train with us today um again close call and it will probably be it's not a long-term injury um but yeah he still had a lot had a bit of pain yesterday so he was not able to train let's see where he is today um so I can't give you the answer yet okay and with the game against Southampton the last time there was a relegation threatened team came to Liverpool and was the Wolves game Liverpool got themselves into a very good position in the first half then the second half kind of relinquished that position a little bit walls had 10 shots Sil for zero um if you're in a similar situation in this game do you know what you need to do to maybe maintain that dominance for the whole 90 minutes uh now we have to act differently that we did in the second half but is not always only up to us it was also the quality of wolves and I think um they they they have a much better season than the league table shows you but we're not here to talk about wolves we're here to talk about Southampton and it's also a team that that that that takes a lot of risks in their in their pressing so they're not afraid to go One V one all over the pitch so if you are not shop or you underestimate things or it's just because they are more aggressive in certain moments they can immediately hurt you and that's also what rules did the second half first half they were maybe a bit lower uh defending a bit deeper uh where in the second half they had nothing to lose and they just came at us and uh we we did had one or two answers because I think we scored a goal which was offside and we had a penalty that was turned over both correct but um but yeah um if a team takes that many risk we saw this with pan J as well it's hard to play through it but only if you only do it once or twice in the right way it immediately leads to a goal and that's what we saw just before halim against Paris s when jot was two won with Lis Diaz and we saw this in the last minute where uh where hary was completely free and Darwin saw him and we scored a goal M hi an um you mentioned luck earlier do you think things have gone in Liverpool's favor this season when you consider things like injuries to other teams and so on uh if you think injuries are only a part of luck or bad luck um then we've been lucky but um we tend or try to believe in the fact that uh we try to prevent them from a certain way of working so that we don't have many injuries I don't see that as luck I see this as first of all uh top professionals our players do everything to stay fit and second of all great facilities and a great stuff but yeah you need to show this over a longer ter uh period of time to consider is luck or bad luck so if if if we can continue doing this for years without many big injuries series then um then it's probably also quality although although you cannot go through a season in the Premier League and in the Champions League and all these cups we play in this country without any injury I've said it before J J has been out for three or four months without a start Ellison Becker has been out for weeks maybe even months Trent has been out Conor Bradley so uh Joe Gomez is out now for for three months so we also have our injuries but yeah you cannot go through a season without an injury it's it's more the amount of injuries that you hopefully try to prevent and it could be luck but I hope uh that we do things in the right way that is not only luck but it's also doing things in the right way thank you than okay
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,JBnprIJOKsc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBnprIJOKsc,an you said before the game you have to suffer at times how do you sum everything up when your goalkeeper was outstanding and after his saves Harve Elliott then produces a match winning moment moment something you sent him on yeah I think when we would have had a draw over here we would have been already the lucky one and I uh that that is clear for everyone I think they were the much better team today um especially in the first half they had a lot of open chances well three or four big big big chances um in the second half they were still the better team still had a lot of shots on target but they were mainly from outside the box but I knew before the game and I saw it today again how much quality this team has and these indiv individual players have so all these shots from them from outside the box are with a with a certain speed that you only see with the top players we have them as well but you see them with them as well that's why Allison still had to make a lot of big saves we were lucky with uh with with with the first half that the goal was fractionally offside I was very happy that in a in a difficult circumstances over here the referee wasn't impressed that's not always in a way games the situation um and yeah in the end we were uh we were already in the game three four five times I felt like oh we can hurt them in transition but we didn't but we waited till the last moment and then we uh we H them you saw what a moment as well that was for Harvey coming yeah like a game time yeah big moment for him um I can understand that he sometimes frustrated about the playing time he gets because he's a good player he showed at Liverpool already that he's a good player but he's in competition with players that are hardly take off so Dominic soers is always the one that just keeps on going also score goals but he's so important for us we have all the all the running he does and yeah Mo Salah is I think uh quite clear for everyone as well so he has to do it with limited playing time but he just keeps on going I have to give him big compliments for that also my staff because they keep working with him uh and every time come up with great exercises so he stays fit but it wasn't only Harvey it was also the one that assisted Darwin Nunes who came from a difficult uh two games but was absolutely there again tonight because from the moment he came in we were um we were more of a threat than before I appreciate it will be different anfield with the atmosphere but what do tonight tell you about the task you still have ahead of you now what it tells me is that we are we are of course one-nil win if you have seen the game it's it's it's it's a very good result for us but we also felt the quality of uh of Parian I knew it before they' won 10 times in a row scored goal after goal after goal incredible play Pace with the Wingers so every underlying St shows you that they were are the best team in the in in in the Champions League uh so we we were the lead table won it but they were in the underlying stats the best team so I wasn't surprised that they were so good so we're definitely going to need our fans in a week time um on um is it is it fair to say he was the toughest position you've had this season and if yes is it because of is's performance or is it also due to the fact that your let's say let's put it mly were under par tonight they were under par and no we were not on the bar it's it's pure the the the the quality of Al and um and the way they've played this whole season I can say it one more time all the underlying stats show you that they were the best team in Europe till now except for the league table but they've had Arsenal they've had uh Bayern Munich they've played Atletico Madrid and they've played Man City and still have the best underlying stats and we they show today and I already knew it but the players saw it today as well and our fans and Hall of England that Luis Enrique made an incredible team here after three uh windows so much paace so much work rate so much quality in the Midfield how they handled the ball so it's um it was an unbelievable challenge for us to get away here with a result and we know it's going to be a hard one in a week we've seen you since very beginning of the match uh your goalkeeper especially running down the clock the clock um do you think do you think the objective the go your goal was actually to to go home with a a draw um I think it's clear you are not used to uh um let me say it in other words I've played games this this season where goalkeepers took much much much more time before they took a goal kick than we did tonight um um or with throwin sometimes it takes a minute uh but that is not for you to know but for me to know we played many of these games I didn't feel we were time wasting today we just tried to play the game uh but uh yeah uh it was clear that as the as the game passed by a draw was the best possible result for us but we in the end we were lucky to even get the win but it didn't feel to me as if we were time delaying that much PSG were particularly brilliant for the first half hour or so but it felt like you managed to sh them up and what were you thinking at that moment and was there anything specific you did yeah we changed a bit the way we pressed in the second half compared to the first half uh and I also agree with you that in the first half they had three or four open chances so one-on ones and a cut back cross that that that just went over the bar and the moment that he went one-on-one and the ball came back and two or three chances in a row so in the first half it was almost a miracle that it was z0 the second half it was more due to their quality that they could create chances because all of their shots were outside the box but these players I just said it already and our players have the same if they get shots from 18 yards or 20 yards it's still half a chance because they can hit it so hard and um that's why I think you you saw two teams that have dominated their league uh they're they're the French Us in England playing against each other with so much quality involved in the game but P and J was by far the better team in ball possession than us Hi H and Trent has obviously had a a lot of scrutiny this season on his defending and he always does but thought tonight even know he's up against some some really top players he he handled it really well what did you think of him yes I agree with you but I see the same thing uh during the season many more times there have been games I think City away was was one of them where he was outplayed a few times but we didn't concede that many big chances against City so sometimes stats are not telling you the truth uh if he if he goes past someone in the width of the pitch it doesn't tell you that he's outplayed uh but the stats that do matter uh I just said already a few times are clear that P is is this season incredible in Europe and in their league but Trent um I think in the first half one or two times he had some difficulties but in general he defended really well especially also in the second half so I agree with you yes take two more questions here good evening coach this type of match details are very important in this type of match there are two teams there's one referee who decided uh sometimes um was really tough for the referee to make a couple of decisions do you have an opinion in regards to the refering tonight the big difference is between French and Netherlands and England is that you guys ask me questions about time delay and about referee decisions where in England I have to talk about this myself and I don't get these questions if uh if we are uh disadvantaged is that the word to say a lot uh that nobody asked me about it um I just said that uh it's not easy for a referee uh if you are referee in um in a game like this where the fans are this uh uh they are so there for the home team um apart from that one moment where you could argue if it's a r yes or no with IU and barola uh I didn't feel he was in favor of us or in favor of them uh it was just a top referee that that should be in a game like this and um I think if the referee would have given if he would have blown his whistle the F would not have overturned it and now it was also clear for me that he should not have overturned it because it wasn't clearly wrong um and it is a big decision that's true and um no I'm not going to say what I want to say let's keep it like this the according to you who is the most confident player for you uh tonight you know uh for the next match coming up against Paris who's the most confident player yeah if you look at the results uh uh We Come Away really uh really positive if you look at the performance and there are two different things I think uh par can take a lot of positives towards uh towards the game we're going to play in a week but I can tell you that uh it's they're not only going to play against us they're only going to play against also going to play against our fans and um we really need them not only next Tuesday Tuesday is Tuesday Tuesday we need our fans on Saturday against Southampton as well because uh like you might know we don't have a winter break in uh in England so we just keep on playing for months already and these players are definitely going to need the help for fans to show up two times as they uh as they've did in the last few months
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,QkGBXQxXLH8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkGBXQxXLH8,hiara good to see you Anor has obviously praised your attitude quite a bit this season in always being ready when called upon but what's it been like for you personally not getting the game time that maybe you would have liked yeah it's a little bit tough for me you know because I don't play that much but uh the thing what I can I can do is you know to help the team so my idea is now very simple I always try to help the team and uh if I have chance to play I just go go in so yeah that's what I'm thinking always and uh yeah I give doing that and you're part of a squad that's reached the League Cup Final your 13 points clear in the title race and you're in the last 16 of the Champions League which is the one that you would most want to bring back to anfield though oh it's a difficult question but yeah you know I I was want to win the old TI so yeah but doing the yeah Premier title is a very great experience it would be it would be yeah so yeah just uh you know focus on the every game coming so yeah that's what I try at the moment yeah so can you win all three and what difference do you see in this side compared to last year when obviously you didn't or you weren't able to add to that League Cup success yeah it's a b disappointed about but yeah I think with did we have been play well last season as well uh in my opin uh because uh uh we went to pre uh Champions League again uh then yeah now uh as we everyone see that um we have been play playing well so hopefully we we keep playing like this until end of the season and uh yeah a CH nothing yeah CH yes have checked a little bit about PSG have you talked about Paris with your teammates and what do you what do you think about uh when you hear Paris you know from your perspective yeah yeah of course I I saw a draw and uh yeah once I saw the the draw yeah I I I was very excited because the PSC is a very good team uh they have been playing so well so far so yeah I know I know that it's going to be a very tough game but uh I think everyone is excited to play uh again against uh uh bsz so yeah what do you think about the Midfield uh the Midfield of Paris you know you may be maybe you you'll be playing there one there yeah I think they have good Midfield and uh yeah they I think they are still young but yeah they're really good players so me as a number 60 of course I have to take care of the those players but I said before like as a team they are good team so we uh try to try to yeah make a yeah we want to we going we going to play like U we we did we have them before yeah hi wo um could you talk a little bit about what the confidence and belief in this squad is like compared to your previous time at Liverpool and previously in your career um I think not only now but I think we have we have confidence to play because that's yeah if you play for Liverpool you need to have confidence to play and we you you always have to try to win and give everything for for for the team so yeah as a as I as a player I always uh try to play with confidence and uh yeah try to win all games so that's the mentality of U being a uh Big C like U and now I think everyone uh is ready for playing the playing the game even though if you don't uh don't start the game or or not so I think we are we are all all all ready to to fight and uh to show theirselves on the beach so I think that's a one of the reason why we have done well so far so yeah we we going to keep working hard for training and on the beach and and at the end of the season yeah and Anna slot has been very complimentary about the way that you play Play Your Role within the squad how do you see it from your point of view I think now I often come off last 15 to 20 minutes uh especially when we are winning situation so yeah the thing what I will think is yeah to have my teammate on the beach so that's very simple to to do my job but yeah it's very difficult to do but that's what I uh always think uh uh to come in the game and uh yeah but now yeah I been I think I I've been playing well so far and uh yeah that's uh what I can help the team in the game so I try to yeah keep playing well when I got have a the bre here apologies hi you've had a lot more minutes in recent weeks for the team was there a moment or maybe a conversation with the manager that that you you felt his trust more was did did you speak to him about not playing so often in the first half of the Season uh yes I have I have uh competition with the uh manager uh a few times in this season and uh yeah but he always told told me that uh uh my attitude and uh what I have done to the team is a always unbelievable so I feel like yeah he uh trust me a lot at the moment and uh yeah that's what I always try to so I'm I'm happy to be here and uh yeah as I said I would I I will keep working hard from the training and uh yeah I'm working hard and on the pit as well yeah last couple one here good evening you're one of the best team in Europe PSG is also strong past two weeks in which area of the game do you think uh the game is going to be uh important yeah everywhere to be honest but yeah I think uh offensively they always try to play football so I think they Winger is the key when they attack because uh they have a lot of good Wingers and I think them is uh the top scorer in the entertainment I think yeah so I I we definely Tak care of him but uh yeah as I said yeah everyone is a good player so and also we have to show we have we are here to to show ourselves so that's a the main thing what what we are thinking always so about definitely it's going to be very exciting game tomorrow yeah last one here sorry it's in French oh no English oh yeah yeah English it's okay yeah yeah no okay um [Music] about oh is it in English oh so I saw you speaking about sorry so yeah about Kate um so you know he's from Paris have you discussed with him about this match has he told you about Paris you know what's Park the stadium have you been you know about it together uh I know I no I I'm I'm know I didn't talk with him about uh about the yeah par is now one M but I think he's he speaks Arab with other players as well so yeah thank you everyone thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just go here first it's nice use red chairs in between you okay honor you could choose between a blue and a red chair and you're sitting on a red one that's a positive thing you know what I could have predicted you'd say that as well okay Anna obviously the written reasons have come out from the fa today regarding your touchline ban there is a discrepancy between what you're accused of saying and obviously what you say you said how do you feel about that and also what are your thoughts on how the whole process has been handled um I think what I've said uh also in the written report and I can say this one more time that um the moment it happened I was quite emotional uh for everything what had happened in the in in the last seven or eight minutes and maybe during the whole game and uh I chose to go on the pitch instead of staying calm staying inside and then talking to the to the referee to Michael uh now I don't have the same emotions anymore so I think I should now uh set a better example than I said back then and don't go into this situation again I think it's clear what I've said and what Michael has written what I've have written um and um and I think Michael has been in the news quite a lot recently and I don't think it helps if I add something to that now now I have my emotions under control well we've spoken about the new format for the Champions League in the past you've said that you weren't sure whether top spot in the league standings would be much of an advantage so I just wonder how much of example is this tie of you not necessarily getting any advantage from what you achieved in the league standings no that's clear uh because I see P's been one of the strongest teams in Europe um and uh I think everyone agrees with me if you've seen them playing the last few weeks and the last few months already so um but that can happen in the in the former format as well so if you ended up number one then there was always one team that ended up number two where you felt like we're hoping not to get that team so it can happen in this format as well and um I think it's a great fixture to look forward to for everyone who loves football both teams scored so many goals this season um quite similar playing Styles maybe not completely uh but the ideas are are quite similar both teams want like to have the ball both teams work really hard without the ball so I can come up with with six seven or or eight similar things that both teams are doing so yeah interesting fixure to look forward to can I just check on Cody gakpo we didn't see him at training has he I think he's traveled hasn't he is he available yeah he uh he was close to be ready to play again but unfortunately yesterday I think it was he had to block a shot so he felt a bit of pain again so we took him with us to judge how he is tomorrow uh if he can be part of the squad yes or no um but it will be a close call John M in the middle um hi on do do you feel because of the form that PSG are in that you have got the toughest draw that you could have got um yeah we could only have two Benfica or Paran J and uh although I like Benfica a lot as well I think uh everyone who watched football the last few months uh could have told you that maybe we had a bit of a um how do you say this uh now we would prefer probably to play against Benfica instead of play J man but this is also a great fixture to play it's a great Stadium to play if you are playing at Liverpool you want to play the big games and this is definitely a big game again for us so um so yes we have to accept what the draw is and it's for both teams are are facing a very strong opponent not only us they as well and so many individual you know comparisons that you can make between the two teams I'm sure that people will pick out Salah and dembele how have you viewed Usman demell returned to to top form really this season what what do you sense that he's done and how's he got back to that level no I think L Enrique did a lot of things really well over here in the past one and a half season uh he really created in a few transfer Windows a team where I think uh I don't know him I haven't asked him but I I assume that he's that he's quite happy with what he created over here not only in team performance but also in individual performance if you look at the Quality Dem B brings to the team at the moment is is is impressive uh so that is one of the many similarities there are both are having attackers in great form scoring a lot of goals and all the other things I just said but uh it's clear that um that Lis Enrique did a great great job over here in the past one and a half season and he was already in the semi-finals of the Champions League last season and uh in my opinion this team is even better than the one that he uh managed last season gentan here the front hello L Georgia as I know in Winter Liverpool wants to buy guia but for now she's his player of PSG what do you think about this player thank you yeah probably you don't come from England because in England people say we we almost by every player that there is in the world so uh uh this is where people like him make their money uh for if you go to England you see Sky Sports you see the whole day everybody's in We Are interest in almost every player in the world it's a big exaggerated um but um so I I cannot talk about if we were interested yes so know what I can tell you is that he's he's he's a great player um he was in in in spetti team from Napoli which I love to watch uh when they were dominating the league in Italy and uh and and doing really well in Europe I think they even faced Liverpool in that season yeah so he's a great player uh and Pim has many of them uh but he's definitely one of them Mel the front hi Arna have you um have you has anyone spoken to you about or have you read much on uh Joe Fagen in his first season of Liverpool he won a treble of league league cup and champions league and how are you feeling actually now that people like Luis Enrique are talking about Liverpool as the best team in Europe uh the first thing I uh I my thoughts are not so much on these kind of things because my thoughts are on par s and if we finish this game it's about Southampton if we finish that one it's again on Paris the good thing this week was it was the first time that we had a bit more time than all the other games we've played because normally there were only two or three days in between uh and that's definitely a good thing because fan J needs all all all our attention and two days would probably not be enough to prepare the the team well enough for this team because uh I'm really impressed with what I saw uh clearly during the weekend 4-nil lead at halftime so um so yeah they are a very good team and uh the other question was just about lri saying Liverpool are now the best team in Europe yeah yeah I think that's um it's it's a nice compliment to get but the best team in Europe has to win the champions league and we are far away from that uh starting uh with a very difficult game tomorrow and then all the difficult ones that are coming up because we already know draw so um I think the best team in Europe at the moment is still real Madrid because they won this competition last season and to say for us someone else can say something different but for us to say that then you first have to win it before you can say this here good evening the league one is um people talk about the league one as you know not being the best level uh what do you think about that yeah that I don't understand uh because I rate the French league quite High um uh because I've I've played quite a lot against French teams um I don't know why it is maybe uh I think uh there are maybe even uh better than some other leagues but history-wise this league these leagues get a lot of attention uh I'm not going to name them because that wouldn't make me popular in different in some other countries but um but it's it's clear that French teams have done um have done well in the past and the French national team is of course one of the best national teams there are in the world and uh and parisan J is is apart from the French league being here Parisian J is over there so um the French league in general but Parian J for sure deserve a lot of for what they've doing in France but also in Europe not the France here so this match is going to be crucial the the areas on the sides uh Enrique was talking about your players being uh air Jets you know really fast players you know um we have Hakimi Hakimi plays really high some times you know even in the offensive side of the pitch how do you think you're going to manage haimi tomorrow yeah I did read that luri said that we had three players that were really fast uh up front um and again I see a similarity because barola if I pronounce his name correctly and de baa are also not slow they are very very very very fast as well qu Scalia so um and then maybe their fourth attacker which is akimi because he's playing as a fullback but he's all the time going up and down up and down up and down uh maybe again a similarity if you look at Trent Alexander Arnold so um yeah um we will have a plan to be in the best possible to show oursel in the best possible way that's what p and will have as well and we will see tomorrow if we face each other how um how things work out g b at the back hi I think Lis hi said they have three planes and that is very hard to stop planes from from flying when whenever counterattacking um are are we seeing a more direct Liverpool tomorrow you think or you're going to try to dispute The Possession with PSG no I think we have we have to show in every part of our game uh uh the best possible performance from this season so it's not easy to dominate ball possession against but because they they take a lot of risk uh when they press so they go man Fe man all over the pitch that makes it hard for many teams to have a lot of ball possession against them um so yeah we have to adapt really well to what's in front of us so I've seen also a few games mainly in the beginning of the Season uh for example against Arsenal where they were not as aggressive as they were in the last 10 15 games they've played when it comes to pressing so um in every part of our game we have to be on top uh in the best possible version of ourselves that can mean um that we have to be really well in the counter attack if they give us a bit more time we have to be really good with the ball and when they have the ball they are um I think Luis andri said it himself they're one of the best or the best team with the ball in Europe and it's uh it's um uh he's definitely right they are definitely one of the best teams when they have the ball with so much attacking threat all over the pitch and so much rotations so so many players taking in different positions so yeah interesting last one with the blue sh hello um what we see about PSG last couple of weeks is they reaction after they lose the ball uh they cont pressing is impressive and how do you want to cope with that tomorrow yeah they are uh uh not only when they lose the ball but also uh in every other part of the game they are quite intense in terms of pressing I think if there's one thing people will tell you about us is that we are quite intense as well um maybe not always going man Fe man all over the pitch like P jandas but we like to uh press aggressive and if we lose the ball do the sameers also so yeah it's so difficult to judge before the game because okay they've played Le we've played Li they were already four in a love at half time I think we were won a love at half time so that tells you how how strong they are but you cannot compare teams by that so tomorrow we have to wait and see if um if they will be on top of us and if they are we have to suffer and we have to be like we were against City uh or hopefully we can uh uh hold the ball uh very well and we can play the similar style we've played for all the other games except for the city one and that's us dominating ball possession we will we will see tomorrow where the game will what the game will bring us thank you everyone see you tomorrow thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,oy3IpbUrKFs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy3IpbUrKFs,an I appreciate it's early but how worthy a candidate is Mo Salah to win the Balon door I should probably throw Virgil Van dijke into that but the reason we speak about MO is because his numbers are so high at the moment so what do you think yeah it's mostly about the techers isn't it although the last winner was I think a midfielder um but yeah it's a good thing that MO is in the discussion because it means he does well it means we are doing well but for him to stay in that discussion he should bring in the same performances as he's done for seven or eight months now and I think in general someone that wins the ball Andor needs to win something as well so it's a great challenge that is in front of us but also in front of him and what I liked a lot is that he takes this challenge not only by scoring a big goal and a great assist against City but uh he also wanted the team to win because his defensive work rate especially in the second half was outstanding and that is I think what it takes for us to have a chance of winning something and um and if we as a team can win something he will have a far more better chance to win an individual prize like the Bor when you say win something do you think you have to win even more than just the Premier League you have to go on and win the champions league as well for Mo to really have that outstanding chance of winning the bondor I it would it would it would uh make his chance only bigger but the last one who won it I think he only won the league and up the Champions League so um it is not only about uh the amount of prizes you win but I think all of the ones that won it in the past probably I don't 100 I'm not 100% sure but probably won either the league or the Champions League so uh that means but in football is always like this you need the team to win an individual prize and um that's what Mo understands at the moment really well because I just said his work rate in especially in the second half but all almost during the whole game was uh was very good and very helpful for us to have a chance of winning uh the game against City with regard to the title race now though how do you enforce the message that it's not over until it is over I don't think I need even to enforce that message because these are the players that played uh and I know the forest fans are going to like me saying this again but these players played the forest home game these players played the Fulham home game these same players played the Manchester United home game and um and the same players played Newcastle away which was a very difficult game for us uh two times being a goal down then being one one goal up and eventually drawing it to fre all so uh I don't think it's necessary we all know these players are so long in this competition even longer than much longer than me so they know how difficult every single game is and if you have to play 11 it's still a long way to them um Alexander esak who you're coming up against is a striker in fine form what do you what is it that makes him such a special forward and and do you have to do anything different to to handle a play like that that's an understatement to say that he's in a fine form I think he's in an excellent form um also over there it's the team performance that will help us controlling him so the more ball possession we have the easier it is to control him although he's definitely a threat on the counter attack as well um the good thing for us is that we've got two C backs that are that are uh probably um one of the best players that are able to play against him I don't say this in perfect English but what I mean with that is that we've got two very very very good center backs and that's that's definitely what you need if you want to if you face a a striker with the quality of of Alexander isak so uh but also with him it's not only about him I like the style of play that Eddie how introduced there they're always a team that is uh um uh has a very good game plan uh they are really intense so with and without the ball high high intense Tempo in the game so that helps a number nine as well because the better your teammates are the more chances you get and uh he's not the only offensive threat they have I think uh Gordon and the right winger as well so there are big threats so um yeah it's not only about him but he's definitely having a great season obviously it was 33 the first first time you play them they're just coming off the back of winning 43 against Nottingham Forest at the weekend what does that tell you about them they can score a lot of goals uh and that's what I was just talking to you about they have so much offensive threat and I think normally they are not a team that concedes so many goals because uh they are very aggressive in defending as well I saw out of Interest not for this game but just out of Interest the semi-final they played against Arsenal now we all know how how well Arsenal is in when it comes to attacking also in defending but in this situation in attacking and they just kept them away from their goal with with defending really strong maybe a bit similar what we did at City uh so defending with 10 or 11 players so um yeah they can score goals but they're also able to defend really strong and that's what makes them such a difficult team to play against morning um the the numbers that MO is putting up in terms of goals and assists at a moment breaking all sorts of record course is he now at sort of peak Ronaldo Messi level so difficult to compare players with each other uh and it's not fair to anyone I think Mo has his own career and mo has been outstanding Messi and Ronaldo both didn't play the Premier League uh but uh I don't want to bring them down because these two players are incredible but that makes the comparison maybe even more difficult uh um so Mo has had uh some outstanding Seasons here at Liverpool and we hope he can continue this for a longer period of time but to do that he first has to extend his contract of course and you don't you guys don't ask me about that anymore so that's a positive this is obviously the final Premier League game of that run of five and 15 days before a few days at least off um what toll does that take though do you have to think about freshening up or how how difficult is that ah not so sure if it is difficult um because these players are trained for this and they're used to this so if they go to a World Cup or to the Euros they have to play those amount of games in a short spell of time as well so uh they were able to do so but it's um I sometimes feel like if we have one gape in between and the game starts I'm like they're not as aggressive as they were so they they in a certain Rhythm and um they've shown this season many times already that they're able to but it was the reason why I changed my lineup against plimouth so drastically because I don't think you can do this for a whole season so you need to have once in every four five weeks a normal week and what I call a normal week is two games in a week instead of three games in a week uh of course that hurt us in the FA Cup uh but um but it also means that these players are now able to play five games in a row at the highest possible level on Sunday just going back to Mo he spoke about the need to win a second premier league title all professional athletes are competitive and driven but what is it about Mo that you've noticed that that drives him uh best question to ask himself what drives him the most but what I see is a top professional not only what you guys see on the pitch but he comes in early works so hard on his body and um some sometimes I get to see a few Instagrams and I I think that he works even at home uh as well so uh if I see how much work they put in over here and then to do something extra at home I think he he found the balance for himself to get the best out of himself that's also what comes with experience with playing so many games at the highest level he knows now what to do to treat his body in the best possible way and for him to get the performances in that he does um but he's not the only one I see everyone in this building uh works so hard and I'm talking about the players now first to get the best out of themselves but all the staff members work incredibly hard as well so we're going to go today it's February now and we again have three pitches over here that are perfectly uh ready for us to train in the best possible circumstances so it's not only about the players that put a lot of effort in to get the best out of themselves it's the whole building and all the people that work here to get the best out of the players as well and on his form you asked for this but his form does it make it easier for the club to want to extend his contract or more difficult because of of how well he's doing in your opinion you can look at it in both in both ways you can say yeah the better he does uh the more expensive he might become and the worse if he would do really worse we would be have second thoughts if he wanted to extend his contract so I think for everyone it's the best that he brings in the performance as he does now maybe only for the one that has to pay him it's not the best but uh for everyone else it's the best because if you want to play at this club you need to be at his level um otherwise yeah probably you you are almost useless to play at this club because we only need players that are at the top of their game because this is one of the best or the best club in the world to play for so um yeah he needs to have these performances for him to play here and hopefully to extend any more for the there any more on Conor bradano and Lex mallister look like he has a black ey is he is he going to be all right to to feature yeah I think he will I think he will uh he will train with us today Connor doesn't he's out for for a few weeks so uh I cannot exactly tell how many but uh it's clear that he went off with with a muscle injury and that's going to take a while before he's backk you thanks honor okay [Music] [Music]
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,Rgqh3E9jp5M,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rgqh3E9jp5M,uh Anna first of all just check on Joe Gomez and Cody gakpo how are they what's the latest um I think both are not available for tomorrow uh Cody is close to being back and um and Joe will will take quite a long time he's he's going to be out for for numeral weeks because of hamr hamstring injury big blow for Joe yeah and for us yeah how's he feel for uh because he tries to do everything to be with the team team he worked really hard to come back and then the first game when he came back uh after two or 3 minutes we saw him making a Sprint and um yeah now he's out for weeks again so yeah that's always very hard for a player in every part of the Season let alone in the part of the Season where everybody is looking forward to you've obviously got the chance to go 10 points clear with this game against Villa it's Villa away um City away Newcastle at home and we can look at it and think you've got a real opportunity over the next week to take a real step toward sealing the Premier League title so how do you see it I see it as 13 games to be played and the next game to be the most important one starting with Fila which is uh like wol at home again a difficult uh game uh for us but for everyone uh they have a great home record um maybe even more if they play in the evening so we know that is going to be a challenge but we have quite okay OA record as well this season uh we've done quite okay this season in general as well so it's it's a game I think for everyone to look forward to to see these two sides playing against each other what have you made though at Villa of late because they've not won a Premier League game since middle of January and that was against Everton and in that time they draw with Arsenal draw with West Ham draw with ips switch but also lost at wolves if you win against Aon that's a special accomplishment isn't it don't know what you mean they are an extremely good runner for at the moment uh no but they did beat Celtic at home in an evening game 42 so um I think uh uh F away when you get the fix list you all know that F away is one of the tougher ones you can face and um but last season was also a very interesting game with it ending 33 if I remember correctly so um very good manager always has a very good game plan uh they brought in quite a lot of good players in the winter break uh as well and they already had a very good team they qualified for top eight in the Champions League so it tells you that it's a it's a strong team we are going to face but uh yeah that's where I started with wol at home was also tough for us so there is um every game in this period of time for every team in the league is difficult thank you good luck morning um one of the players they bought in recently was Marcus Rashel I'm sure he be desperate to play in this game um is he someone you'd have to pay particular attention to as he obviously tries to revitalize his career yeah uh the first time uh of course I know Michel R because I followed the Premier League but the first time I faced him real life was uh in the USA tour and I was impressed I was really impressed how fast he is how uh he has a nice height comfortable with the ball so I think he's a very good player and uh I hope for him as well that he's going to show that at filler of course I'm not hoping that he will do this tomorrow but uh I would be completely surprised if uh if a player of that quality is not going to show this in the upcoming months because uh yeah he's a he's a very good player in my opinion it it was obviously nervy at the end against wolves is that only natural though at this stage in a title race and is it anything can you do anything to affect that I think it is because we are going to the end of the season and not because of us but because of what people make of it because we've played more games at home or away that we let by one goal and in the end it was also tight so I can remember Crystal Palace away where it was really tight in the end and we had to and fto had to make a big safe uh to uh to secure the win and we didn't even need a big safe now to secure the win but yeah if then this happens in the end of the season people you guys or I started going to talk about Nerfs but yeah uh secure a win in the Premier League uh if you are only leading by one goal is always going to be a lot of Defending and a lot of hard work uh yeah and during lastar parts of the season it's just hard work and in the end part of diseas and it's we talk about nerves thank you not me but a lot of people talk about nerves there Anna when you won the title with f in the in the running think it was five times six games where you won by one goal so I'm just wondering what experiences can you call upon from that run in to potentially help this season I think it always helps if you've experienced it it already and that's not only for me that's also for the players uh but uh it's difficult to take things from that period of time towards this period of time different players different opponents different league so but it tells you again what I've what I've said so many times that in the end phase of the Season it is a lot a lot of games are really tight it's not only ours if I just look at all the results I even saw yesterday playing Barcelona was the team I admire a lot and play really good football this season but they in the end they were close to conceding the 1-1 so it is the end phase of the Season where results like this are quite common like in our uh title winning season with fin out as well it tells you that you have a team that fights till the end and um and and these games you need to win if you want to achieve something I know we're focusing on the one goal margins but um player that came on on Sunday and did really well in achieving that was raro Endo and that was only his fourth game of the season the Premier League where he's played more than 10 minutes excluding stoppage time as well just wondering how crucial do you see someone like him being in terms of seeing out games towards the end of the season when as you say it could be so tight I think wat has been really uh useful for us this season it's not always a matter of how many minutes you play you can be very important in 2 minutes and you can be less important than 90 minutes but what makes wat special in my opinion is every time we have to rely on him if it's 5 10 or 20 or 25 minutes he shows up and that that sounds much more simple than it is because if a player hardly hasn't have a lot of playing time then to be mentally so strong that if the team needs you you can bring your best performance and that's not all always easy because mostly you see players that don't play a lot find it difficult to get their Rhythm or their quality in the less playing time they get the only thing is defending is always more easy than creating so uh if you play a player that hasn't played for a long time and it has to create something he has to create something is always more difficult than uh than defending but uh he's been important for us uh and uh and he will be important for us in the upcoming weeks as well we we've heard already the talk about nerves and pressure the running started I'm just wondering with with the experience of the players you have in dressing who have been there and done it already how much do you lean on them to to deal with it themselves or pass on that experience to people and how how to handle it now I we lean a lot on the players because uh we train with them we try to prepare them I give them a a pre-match meeting to try to uh prepare them in the best possible way but from that Mo that moment onwards you lean on the players uh how much work right do they want to put in uh how how well do they execute the game plan do they adapt to what the what the other team does so uh so yes you always adapt uh on players and I think it helps you if if a team or a player already want something but don't make that too big because you just have you still have to play for it and you can't compare the circumstances uh so the ones that won the league here already that was in Corona time without fans being in the stadium they were if I'm correct at a certain point 25 points up yeah so you can hardly talk about pressure then uh uh although I'm a type of manager if there 10 games to be played and I'm 25 points up I still feel like oh we have to win to uh but uh no there's hardly any pressure then but uh we do do lean on the players we because they have to they have to show up and they have to bring the performances in but not in the manner that they are today tomorrow or whatever date they do present a meeting on uh how to deal with with depress no that's not how it works but but the players you've got in there think L of Virgil Allison but they are so experience and and and they've had that level of of experience to be able to to just s of you put it all to one side and just concentrate on on the job yeah no but it helps not in a sense of that they've won the league here maybe but it helps that they are used to playing big games in their careers we have a lot of pressure that's also for for Maka who's won the World Cup so players that are used to playing in those kind of environments so for example Aon away is a hostile environment it helps if you've already experien this once or twice so that why it was so good for Connor Bradley because I think it was his first to experience it and I assume next time he will only he played quite okay but will only play better the next time because you get more and more used to big games and that is one of the things what very talented players need to have they need to have playing time and it's mostly more comfortable if you play at home with anfield and everything you do fans cheer for you where if you play in a away game if you do something very well fans don't cheer for you so that is something uh a player has to go through and the more experience you have in playing big games the better it is but um but some young players don't have maybe the experience of big games but they make the right decisions because of quality so we must not overvalue experience but it does help uh in certain situations hi an you mentioned after the Wolves game that there's more of a mental toll of the recent games rather than necessarily a physical toll um considering the play you're playing at the moment every three or four days is it actually harder to get the players to reset and recharge mentally than it is physically because obviously they can sit in an ice bath or recharge but they might still be thinking about the last game or the next game to come yeah no it depends on how the last game went and that's why I said after the Everton game it wasn't a surprise to me that the players were they weren't tired but they were more tired than they maybe were in previous games because the Everton game the way that game went uh all the things that happened during that game and then especially in the last eight minutes that uh that that costs a lot of energy uh for everyone that was involved um so um that's why you can't compare tomorrow with last Sunday I think uh we had a good win we didn't play our best football but to go away with a win gives us different uh reaction then after the the Everton game where we eventually conceded in the last second with so many things happening uh that probably was the reason why we were a bit more a bit not that much and not everyone because I think if I had only one or two players in my mind that looked a bit exhausted the rest didn't but um so on the other side of that the fact that they were able to come through a similar challenge against wvs and they face against Everton will that give them a maybe a mental boost going into to these next two tough games against pH and Manchester City I think we we managed many times already to get a win over the line where we I think we won quite a lot of games with one goal difference I'm not even sure but I think we did uh but there were also moments Newcastle away where we conceded in the last minute man united at home where we conceded I think 5 to 10 minutes before the end and now this game yeah these things happen in a strong league as well that you you sometimes concede a goal in the last minutes of the game of course it gives us confidence uh that we this time brought the win over the line again like the Everton game we didn't give anything away in the last 20 minutes uh till the moment uh uh at Everton we all remember um so yeah uh we do take Confidence from both last 20 minutes because we had a certain feeling about the goal we ConEd as well um so both games give us confidence but yeah it definitely helps that we didn't concede in the same manner as we conceded against Affton in the last minute just on Joe is there any danger he'll miss the rest of the season he will miss miss large part of the end of the season but he we expect him to be back in the end phase of the Season yes will will he need surgery uh he might but that's something we still have to assess and sorry son some his first premier league stting October he obviously has injury issues and he've been managing his his minutes when he has been available if you can keep him fit from now until the end of the season just what role can he play to be all seen how good he was before he picked up that injury against Chelsea yeah uh a role like many others so uh he's done so well before his injury and uh I think I've said it during during the weekend I couldn't even remember when his last start was for us in the Premier League so I think we've missed him three three four months when it comes to a start I always look at you if it's what that's Chelsea yeah no that's that's a long way back so we've missed our the number nine that played in the first uh uh seven or eight games every single game almost for three or four months but now he's back and uh he played 60 and uh with these amount of games we play now you don't expect him to play 909090 in the upcoming free but he will be involved in hopefully all the three games and hopefully with a lot of minutes as well [Music]

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] mixed it's got mixed with my family as well first of all honor can we check on Trent Alexander Arnold and Joe Gomez and their respective injuries uh Trent is uh has done parts of training sessions with us uh not session session yesterday uh so let's see how he is today he will train hopefully with us again and then we have to decide if we take him to the game yes or no and Joe is uh it's it's his same lack again where he had the injury last time we are still assessing that but he will definitely not be available uh tomorrow the practice the same how much of a concern is that that's mostly a concern that's mostly a concern uh obviously we weren't necessarily talking up the chance of a quadruple but the chance of winning all four trophies has now gone what impact does that have if any impact at all I should have impact because if you're working at a club like this you should uh compete for every trophy we've said us from the start and then to go out in the second occasion so we bought we beat uh Aon Stanley but to lose against Plymouth is is of course not acceptable and um so uh as a team uh and I think our fans as well are disappointed by that result and um yeah now we have to show a different side of us tomorrow because it wasn't only the result uh the performance was far from what uh Liverpool standards are as well both Liverpool and Everton and tied on 41 Mery side Derby victories at goodon Park with that in mind as well what consideration do you also have to give to it being the last ever Mery side Derby at cson Park sorry I just wonder what consideration you have to give to it being the last ever Mercy side Derby at goodon Park as well because there'll be a lot of emotion C from aonian perspective behind that and maybe that can impact the atmosphere on the night as well yeah I think it's it's an extra reason why the atmosphere will probably be will be even better than all the occasions before but I haven't been to one but people tell me at Gooden Park as at Enfield but it's always a fantastic atmosphere uh home supporters are there to support their team and the away fans are mostly loud as well so uh it's um it's probably going to be a fantastic atmosphere and that's always uh that's never easy to play to play against because um uh every single time they cross the halfway line or they get a corner kick or whatever happens the fans will cheer for that and then you have to be mentally really strong as an away team to resist all that the complete atmosphere and and and you still have to be focused on what you have to do defending the corner kick defending the set piece and when you have the ball be as calm as you can in this fantastic atmosphere but it's not the first time for these players that they are playing in atmospheres like this so uh I hope that they can focus on what they have to do but it's not only tactical you also have to uh stand up to those emotions but because um I've noticed that also in the blim of game that uh the intensity of the tackles the how aggressive they were that that was quality of their players but it was definitely also because of the otions in the stadium so we have to be up for that and um I've seen the game of last season for example and uh I think we were quite ready because after 10 minutes the referee blew his whistle 11 times and 10 times in favor of Everton so the Liverpool players were ready to compete but every time they touched him it was a free kick uh so uh I assume our players are ready for uh for another battle tomorrow for the simple reason that they've been ready for the whole season and many of them are experienced for this time on um because of that atmosphere how important is keeping a a cool head in a situation like this for the players yeah cool head but uh not cool Le so uh um every time you play against a team uh that wants to fight with you and that's almost every time we play against any opponent but maybe this one even more you have to to be ready for that so you have to run just as much you have to be just as intense in tackles uh not going across the line but be uh uh cool enough to uh to play a good and firm tackle and um that's where it starts with and then nine out of 10 times after 10 15 20 minutes a game settles down a bit and then you can start to think even more about playing football but like I said uh last season in the first 10 minutes there were 10 free kicks in favor of Everton and I think you know what they did with these free kicks they brought them in every single time and it l in the end I think after 1050 minutes to their one nil so um so yeah cool hat but uh but not cool lexs how different do you think is the challenge of this Everton under David Moyes to the one that you would have faced in the original fixture early in December when obviously Everton were were struggling at that point yeah yeah they were to a certain extent I think picked up some good results as well away at city and uh I think away at Arsenal as well some clean sheets some draws I think those were were very good results from an Aon perspective as well if you go away if you have to play away games like that but uh yeah you cannot um uh let's say it differently um I'm aware of the fact that David took over four games and he's won free uh so that is definitely uh a great accomplishment for him and they are definitely maybe now in a better place than they were a few weeks months ago but yeah the weather circumstances are a bit better maybe as well I H it seven out of the last 10 merys side Derbies at goodison Park have been draws what does that tell you and has that played a a part in your preparations for this one now definitely tells you how difficult it is for both teams to win from each other uh and um so when David Moyes came there in 2002 he took a team that were was fighting against relegation and he made it a club that was in the end playing top four so uh he done incredibly well but the last few seasons Everton were more playing uh were not competing top four anymore so a team like that normally Liverpool uh would get more points or more wins uh against teams that are around Everton than the ones they did over here so it tells you how difficult the away lck for Liverpool is if they play Everton away um and yeah that um that we all know because as long as I'm in football I know that dubies are always more difficult than facing the same team that's somewhere around that position in the table but then it is in the derby that's that's that's clear because fans bring the best out of players I've experienced this a few times already here at anfield I've experienced this many times at my former club and I hope I'm not going to experience that tomorrow but I think the fans will bring the best out of the Aon players tomorrow again this is the first of five games in 15 days in the Premier League for you some some really big important games in there as well will this period here Define your Premier League season no because this period five games in 15 days is what we've done uh for seven months now so all every phase of the season is crucial if you play Premier League this is the hardest league to win because there are so many teams that can win this league and there are so many teams that are able to win 10 15 games in a row uh so you cannot slow down or you cannot uh have a few games that you are not on top of your game because then all of a sudden uh another team catch you up that's what the Premier League is that's why it's such an exciting league and such a beautiful League to work in and for the fans that's why the whole world is looking at it for that reason in my opinion Arsenal last season after they went to Qatar I think they won the first eight games and only lost two of the last 15 or 17 but but still city were able to win the league because they probably win every single game I don't know exactly but um so yeah that's the league we are in so the upcoming Five were important but after that the nine afterwards were important but the first uh uh how many games did we play 23 something like this 24 has been just as important obviously no one wants to get knocked out competition but would the one positive be that it frees up a bit space to be able to manage the workload for the two competition and one final you've got left um there was a wise man that once said to me uh nothing could comes from losing a football game and I uh I completely agree so we would definitely have preferred to play six games in 18 days or seven in 21 or eight in 24 uh because that's what that's the schedule we are in now with us losing this game there's one moment uh where we have a normal week but uh that's definitely not what we wanted when we went to Plymouth uh so um we were um how should I say this it was um it was difficult because the plan was of course to play with Joe for for for 60 minutes or longer the plan was to start Curtis but uh he came out uh s Sunday saying that he didn't feel well enough to play so then all of a sudden we missed two important players I think uh people know Darwin situation that he became a dad uh one or two days before the game so uh and that happened in Spain so he came in a bit later so there were some circumstances that weren't perfect when it comes to would have the idea was to play with an even stronger team than we did now but still this team should should should have been able to win that game and the fact that we didn't and we didn't against PSV as well also tells us that these players definitely need these games to get the best out of them because it's so difficult to get the best out of them if they hardly play any games and that's why again it's disappointed that we don't have this extra game for them in uh in 18 days hi um we've spoken a lot about fast starts over the course of this season and we've seen Everton start really fast in the last two home games three up at halim if you look at the away games Liverpool haven't won this season they've been behind in half at halim against Newcastle Arsenal and Forest so how important do you think that early period of the game is going to be over getting the result oh I think um 90 minutes of the game are very important and in the first 10 minutes or first 15 minutes uh in away game it's even more important not to go behind because if you go behind then the fans are even more having even more emotions and then they cheer for everything if you kick a ball outside the stadium they still cheer but if you are one nil down and you do the same they're all booing you so uh it's definitely important in an away game not to go behind the reasons why we drop points against the teams you just said Isa probably more because these teams have a lot of quality and that for that reason we went uh a goal behind and then it has to do with us starting not so well uh because I said it before but at Forest the four five minutes we started really well with one Counterattack led to led to their goal yeah so uh yes it's important in a way came to control the emotions of the crowd and uh the worst thing you can do is uh is come and go behind because then the emotions will be there for as long as till the moment you have a two goal lead uh but till then the emotion will be very positive for the home team so yeah that's why uh being focused and concentrated in a away game is even more important than in the home game last for the than it's okay [Music]
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,kJra7_qLom0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJra7_qLom0,uh not a lot um but as after every game uh we go with a few people drink a glass of wine and uh then we go home because uh it was quite late already when uh when the all my media duties were done is there an update on Trent Alexander Arnold will he be available this weekend no I don't think so yet no no that's that's going to be too early for him Derby maybe or uh we don't play Derby County the Derby oh the Derby uh yeah difficult to say it's it's like I said before it's not going to take months uh and and not even weeks but that will be yeah uh that's only three days after the P of varar game so let's wait and see if he's available we also have to look at the long term of course we don't want to take any risk with so many games afterwards coming up but um if he's fit then of course we will use him how key is rotation again this weekend and what kind of a balancing act do you have because there's a number of players that I'd imagine you want to give game time because you want to get their match sharpness up but at the same time if you have too many players in there who aren't fully sharp it can make these ties that bit trickier for you yeah I think it's always a tricky tie um no matter what team you play because um it's an away game uh it's it's it's their final probably uh as as many times if Liverpool comes anywhere so um but it is true that if you play with a team that hasn't played so much together that that is always for the players a bit more difficult but I think we've seen already a few times when we played with uh team that hasn't played much together even in oven in the Champions League game these players were able to play a very good game and um so I I think it's important these moments for some players that don't get many playing time to have that playing time so whenever we need them they are ready if you never play them then it's so difficult for them to be ready if we do get some injuries or suspension so um so yeah we will definitely use a few players that haven't played that much um but um we will make that final call uh tomorrow last night Jamie carer described Virgil Van djk as being too good for the highest level of football he went on to say it almost feels like there should be another level above for van dijk because he plays the game with such ease which backs up the argument that he could be the best ever Center half in the Premier League I just wonder what you think and also what you hope the future brings for him both this season and Beyond so they are friend again yeah no I think uh fil deserves every compliment he gets he's been outstanding for this club for so many years and since I'm working here he's been outstanding for me as well uh for the performances he brings in and yesterday was again an example of that he was um he was also a uh in a good way uh in a good manner aggressive he let the team in in in in a way with the ball we all know what he can do but also with out the ball he was sharp and ready and um it was not a coincidence that it took 80 minutes before they had the first shot on target so fil like many others have have a has a great season has a good season sorry but he wants just like all the others to make it a great season and therefore we have to play Still many games and what do you hope future brings for him uh uh how do you say this uh a health uh good health a good health yeah for him and his family that's the first thing I wish him and I hope I can enjoy working with him for a long time but that I don't think is a surprise for you is not at all thank you cheers uh Conor Bradley showed last night again what an attacking threat he can be getting that assist for the third goal and the runs he makes for a right back quite unusual for a right back often through the center really high up how do you make sure that there are no gaps left defensively when he's making so many runs like that first of all not lose the ball that's the smartest thing uh you can do and the good thing is that the players that have the ball and he has to understand when he has to make that run and this was uh what it led to the F0 very good choice because Maka had the ball and he had the ball quite open so he was not under any threat and if Maka has the ball I would make a run as a teammate as well because it's a fair chance that he will find you in the perfect moment in the perfect pass with the perfect pass so um first of all it's about the timing when do you make this runs if the ball is under fret then maybe it's not a smart moment but if the ball's completely open and we can change sides it's a perfect moment for him to start his run and uh of course we Al always have IBU and Virgil and the other fullback behind the ball including Ryan so if if if for whatever reason we do lose the ball over there it's not like there are no Defenders left anymore I know fans have been very happy with Conor's performances when he's played if Trent Alexander Arnold were to be injured for a long time or if he were to leave the club is is Conor Bradley good enough to be your first choice regular right back he would be proud of you that you come up with a different idea of asking this question uh I think uh uh it's fair to say that uh for many positions we have two very good players so that's for the right fullback position for the left fullback position we've got more than two good center backs and I can go up uh through the whole team uh telling you this so um it's also normal if you work at a club of this magnitude and that wants to compete for every trophy that you have more than 11 good players and fright fullback position is definitely an example of that AR several of the players have talked about this year having more time to live a normal life than in the past being being uh uh husbands in some cases fathers is that something that you consciously take into account to to kind of uh keep the squad fresh keep them happy and and I mean is that a conscious strategy or it just so happens that uh compared with your predecessor that's just the way you do things I can compare with how it was but it's it's definitely if you want to call the strategy but it's definitely I see them as human beings as well and um we are working very hard if we are here at the aan and if we are playing a game I think that was a great example yesterday again of how hard these players work but um if you want to just keep on going for such a l season because they never have a week or two weeks off then I think at certain moments they have to be at home as well and being a father uh or a husband as well because if you are only a football player for for 15 16 17 years we we only three weeks off uh during the summer and if you can only be a father or a husband for three weeks a year that would not be uh human so of course we take this into account but we do these things mainly because we think it benefits us for winning football games so and part of that manifest itself in for example staying at home the night before for a home match rather than all gathering in a hotel as has been done in the past that's part of it the other part is that people tell me uh and the people that that have more knowledge than me about this that you always sleep better in your own bat than in a hotel bat so um and sleep is a very important part of uh getting the perform getting the best possible performance so it's not only the argument you just gave for them to be at home uh with their families but it's definitely also that they are better prepared for a game in the opinion of people that tell me this uh and I have no no reason not to believe them because if you use common sense I think everybody can understand that you sleep better in your own bat than in the hotel bed so if it's not necessary we indeed sleep uh at home hi um Li were in contention for all trophies last season before the form dropped off are the team better placed to go for four this season it's difficult for me to judge because I wasn't here last season um so I don't know uh I can only tell you that we are in at this moment of time in a very good place and I'm uh not only talking about the result yesterday evening but the players are fit are ready not only the 11 that were on the pitch yesterday but the ones that came in as well um so we're in a good place but um we also know how long the season still is and how how many difficult challenges there still will still be for us but um we are in a good place there's only one downside of beating uh um Tottenham 4-0 because the last time we beat him 63 I think it was a week later that we beat West Ham 5- nil and all of a sudden that was the bar so when we when we just started winning one nil everybody was saying they don't have the same form anymore um so um yeah we are in a good place but I'm not expecting us to win every single game in the manner we won it yesterday but that's also not what I ask of them we just try to do everything to win every single football match and if it can happen like yesterday in such a good and dominant performance that's perfect if not we have to find another way to win that game James H just had you about James McConnell he took the decision not to loan him out um and keep him around for the rest of the season what is it you've seen from him that's impressed you so much I think you watch the PSV game as well uh so that's what you see and what I see is him on a training pitch competing with all other midfielders uh and then I see a player that is like I just said competing with them so um always gives everything he has and uh Tyler Morton um is out with an injury for a for for a while so that means um yeah I think he was maybe our sixth midfielder and um and James is taking that position for for the upcoming weeks as well so it's a it's a combination of both it's him doing really well and the injury of Tyler Morton what's Tyler done um is am I allowed to say that or yeah it's his shoulder he has a shoulder injury how long do you think he'll be helpful four or four weeks or maybe even longer yeah I check on Allison is Allison I didn't know what the issue was yesterday say he just rested far as yeah I think I said before the game that we uh almost every time we've played the second goalkeeper in the league cup so uh at Brighton it was fit because at that moment of time queef was the number number one because Elan was in injured at that moment there was only one exception and that was Tottenham away where Allison came back from an injury and I F and felt he needed some extra playing time um because if you come back from an injury you see this with many players uh they sometimes need a bit of time to be at their best again they're still good but for them to be at their best again and then three days later we played the acon sunny game and then three days later we played forest and with him being just back from an injury for me it felt better for him to play and then have a weak rest and then have nothingham Forest so that was more with the idea of the being best possible prepared for the league and yesterday was a League Cup game so um that meant que was on go and he absolutely deserved to be on goal for everything he did this season until now you believe it so because the fans decide they'll play the final we never know what the situation around the final is how uh how fit is everyone do do they need a game yes or no so I cannot guarantee anything I never guarantee anything to wor players so far in advance and that's not what I'm going to do now as well hi an um you spoke earlier about the difficulty of leaving play out the squad when they've been fit and training well depending upon obviously the outcome of this game and maybe a subsequent draw this could be the last game of the season for some players in the squad so in that desire to impress and maybe stay involved is there a danger maybe their performance is more about their individual Ambitions rather than those of the team and is this something you maybe discussed with some of them no I don't discuss this if I have to discuss this now I didn't do my work properly for the first six seven or eight months I think I tried to convince them every single day that um the individ only the individual performance can be on of a high level if the team performance is of a high level and if they now think that they need to do individual things to get playing time from with me then then I did something wrong in the past seven or eight months they don't get playing time because they score free goals or have a great attacking uh they first of all need to work as hard for the team as for example with the players did yesterday and if you cannot not bring this then you have hardly any chance to come into the team if you do bring this then I'm not judging them on quality because I know all of them have quality so then sometimes you have a good game sometimes you have an okay game but uh the only thing I the standard is that you work incredibly hard and that's the only chance you have to come into into this team I the Aston Villa games now move forward to think the 19th yeah do you have any view on on that or it's just one of those things success we want to be uh competing for every trophy we want to be in every competition don't then we must not complain about the amount of games we have to play uh so um I don't see an advantage or disadvantage so we play probably Sunday Wednesday Sunday or something like this in Aston Villa we'll probably do the same so um it is what it is uh I said before two two or three days ago maybe the last time I have to talk about this that if you are a club that has to play so many games even clubs that don't have have to play so many games have 22 23 players uh and then to go to a to a game with 20 players that's not a problem because you can only make five substitutions but you want to create something and you want to give Academy players a chance once in a while as well and if you can only bring 20 players that is the biggest problem for the Academy players if I would have had 23 Players yesterday then James McConnell and maybe Rio or Trey were in the squad and it was an ideal moment for them to get a bit of playing time yesterday but yeah I could only bring 20 so I think if you look at the long-term future for England uh for their players for the Academy players would be a smart decision to go to 23 and don't tell me that that is the disadvantage of the of the smaller clubs because I have nine fantastic substitutes if I have 20 so it's not a that I then all of a sudden have 12 great substitutes that is nine is already enough but it's more giving chances to to younger players as well uh that would be beneficial if we go to 23 like every other league in Europe except for TR Alexander Arnold and Tyler how happy are you to have a fully fit squad or nearly fully fit Squad at this stage of the Season yeah you can ask answer that question yourself I think as well it's um it's it's something you want if you have to play so many games and the importance of the games only are growing and growing and growing you want to have as most players available as you can and I have to give big compliments not only to the performance staff but also to the players because they put a lot a lot a lot of effort in to stay as fit as they are it's not only what they do on the training ground or what they do during the game if you look at them how professional they are around uh the training session before and after then it's not a surprise to me that they stay as fit as as they are at the moment I you said a couple of months ago how we thought Darwin had a couple of things to improve in terms of his all round game the last few weeks his linkup play seemed very good to me at least what what have you made of Darwin and his all round game the last month or so yeah better indeed uh I think in general we use the number nine better and better than we maybe did in the beginning of the season so uh that is the positive thing of playing more games training more together have more meetings together that you can highlight that a bit more as well I think in the beginning of the Season we were quite dependent on our Wingers but I see that we are starting to use our nine more and more in situations that we have to use him and as a result of that these players come in promising positions and they have just as much quality as our Wingers so if you put J in the promising position or if luch your plays there or Darwin they will give you what we're all hoping for and that's golden is thank you everyone yeah thank you it's okay
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,V1rQ2DJbS_Q,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1rQ2DJbS_Q,yeah hi Anna nice to see um first off we'll just start with Trent Alexander bats okay just wondering how he is and if he's going to miss any game time yeah he is going to miss the game tomorrow so um and we have to see if he's able to play Sunday but what we do know is that he's not available for tomorrow um what kind of injuries is it die problem yeah I think you you saw that he left the pitch with uh with a bit of a pain in his lack so um that's why he misses the game tomorrow but he's already on the pitch not with the team but with uh with the with the reap coach so um let's see how long it's going to take but he will not be available tomorrow um obviously the first time we've spoken to you since the end of the transfer window so I'm just wondering there another quiet one at Liverpool just wondering your thoughts on the window as a whole and because don't know many coaches that quite often say I don't want any players you're in a window I don't know but maybe there are not many managers that have such a good squad as I have so um I've I've said it many times um we have a very good squad and and if you look at the league table I think the players have shown uh that the trust we have in them was correct and we don't have apart from Trend now maybe for for a few few days but we don't have many injuries not long-term injuries in moments that the windows are is open so we did have some injury problems with Allison with j and with some others but at the moment I think apart from Trend they all available again today so then there's no there's not another reason uh to add something to the team unless you have a chance in the market but um yeah that's something we saw last time with the goalkeeper we brought in which is not here but we did brought brought them in because we saw it as a chance in the market but for now we are happy with the team we have just want to ask you about V we know there've been discussions about uh semi-automated off sides coming in before the end of the season and referees announcing key decisions to the crowd next season just want to know your thoughts on that uh for me that's not necessary because uh um I see uh when the referee makes a decision I I go back I go two steps backwards and I see the live coverage of everything but that's probably not available for every fan in the stadium so if the fans like it uh and it's a it's a something nice for the fans then let's do this I wonder if we are all uh we're all going to like this but um yeah uh for me it's not necessary but if the fans really like it let's continue with this and let's see if they do because the last time it happened it I was there it was in um in the Spurs Stadium yeah that was so obvious that it was not really necessary to announce that it was offside uh I think the one where we were all more interested in why didn't he gave the second yellow card and that is something he didn't have to explain but I think it maybe if he if he would have explained and it wasn't in um disadvantage for the home team then maybe it comes even more pressure on the referee so I wonder if it's a good thing for the referee because he's already under a lot of pressure uh uh in every uh game from the home fans and I think this this this him explaining if it's against the home team would even add more pressure in the next and the next and the next decision he has to make but they always tell me they are well very well trained for this which I am certainly not because if I have to blow my whistle during a a a training uh session then I'm always like M okay he's a bit frustrated let's give him the free kick for the next time but uh um so I will probably not be a good referee but yeah that's my opinion about it hi I'm a different game different competition different circumstances but in terms of reference points for the game against Tottenham how valuable was that match against Bournemouth because it had a a real Cup tie feel to it in terms of the E and flow of the game yeah but I think every game game we play every training session we have uh we are trying to work on our habits and uh what I mean with that is we have to do as much thing in the right way as we can and every time after the session we have a postm after the game or the session we have a postmatch meeting and we tell them what they did well and what they can improve as a result of that we are hoping that they going to make steps during the season constantly to come as Clos as we can to the perfect game in the end of the season so a game like this definitely help but it's the same Forest away or the same um away against brenford we learn from every single game we play uh because every single game uh we we are faced with different challenges and the more challenges you face the better you are ready for the next one it's kind of like halime in the tie after the one nil defeat at Tottenham it's unusual for Liverpool to be behind in terms of Since since you took over this season do you have to prepare prepare the players mentally for for the game against Tottenham the second leg because it is different territory and to go behind at anfield all of a sudden it becomes a really tall order not impossible but but more difficult no I don't think I have to prepare them uh differently than to any any other game because from now on until the end of the season and that's been already the whole season and I think as long as Liverpool exists if you play in this shirt you need to win the game that's for tomorrow that's for Sunday that's for Wednesday afterwards and the game after that so uh even if we go one nil down in the league or whatever tournament we are in we try and and want to win the game that's also what we tried in the away game against Tottenham I think we were quite close to get a result over there till uh uh the last few seconds um we were down to 10 and conceded a goal but um yeah there's no nothing changes for this game compared to all the others if you wear this shirt if you go out of the endfield there's only one thing that is expected of you and that's winning the game on the unusual for it's unusual for two-legged tide to take place so far apart does that make any the whole transfer window between the two games usually they're back to back we do that make a difference anything yeah now you tell me I'm like yeah you were right uh uh is this unusual for England as well or is this usual in the in the League Cup it's unusual think for this one use this for a okay yeah um yeah not that it matters a lot but uh uh if if you play one week later then normally you face exactly the same same team again uh and now with all the injuries uh Tottenham had last time we played them uh would have been a bit more in our advantage if we played them one week later again although we lost against the ones that were fit that time uh but indeed they uh they did brought in three players I think one of them was already there the goalkeeper was already there in the window so now we Face two two different ones um I wonder if Mickey F Defan is ready to play he he of course has a big big impact on uh on that team so yeah it it it it might change uh the quality we Face Tomorrow compared to the last time but we were already not able to win from the team that played last time so um it's going to be a difficult one which we know if you reach the semi-final against Tottenham you know it's going to be a difficult one but um I think we will be better than uh the last time as well with Trent being out an opportunity for the conad madebe to to play um after experienceit and is that was that an important learning s learning curve for him I played the game against Tottenham uh also uh back then um I just said it as well I think every single game every single training session has something to learn uh or if it isn't then it wasn't a good training session I gave them because I think you're trying to give them something which they where they can learn from every single session every single game and that is something uh there were I think we played in 0 in quite a good game if you take into account the team we've played with so this team hardly ever played with each other uh but we did concede free goals and if I then uh take a closer look at those free goals I don't even think we did much wrong but only some small details and and that is something at the level like PSV or tomorrow if you do a small detail wrong you can concede a goal and um yeah that's also something the feedback we gave Connor and he wasn't involved in every goal but he was in one in my opinion uh where he he he he didn't follow the overlap uh aggressive enough and that led to uh I think the third goal hi an um you spoken previously about your desire to get more goal and chances for your number nines uh in the last six games the starting number NES only had four shots on target from nearly 400 minutes however in those six games we've also had a goal from J two goals from new of brenford and two from GPO from that Central position on the pitch so are you happy for your central Striker to be more of a facilitator or are you still trying to get them more goals uh I will be happy if if that player becomes both so facilitator nice words I didn't uh know that one yet uh and scoring goals himself that's that's again what we want to achieve in the end uh but I also saw uh the penalty from from Cody where where luo as a nine played the part without even touching the ball uh so he dragged the center back out which led to the fact that Cody was in a one V one and he he made a Deep Run and got tripped what which led to the Penalty so in the end uh you want attackers midfielders to score we've spoken about our attacking midfielder as well uh we need to uh get goals from every from many positions including them including center backs that can score from set pieces also um so that's what I just said we are trying to work on the training ground and um and with the feedback we give them after the game to to make the team better and better and better and in the end the number nine should should be a facilitator like a Winger but a Winger and a nine should also score goals and last one for just ask about the goalkeeper situation made his decision obviously Queen playing his competition a lot play Alison in the first leg so you know what you can do there I know but the to goalkeepers don't know yet so if I'm going to leave this room I'm going to go to the to the media next door and then afterwards I'm going to inform the goalkeepers which decision I've made just on the squad you said only Trend out that means you do have to leave players out your squad and on the mat that as a manager I guess that is the luxure you want but how you go about that news CU B how how he deliver that keep them yeah that's that is one of the only things I don't understand here in England so everywhere around the world and in in Europe as well when we play Champions League we can take 23 players to the game and we are here in a country where we play the most games especially like the likes like ason Villa us Arsenal Chelsea all the ones that are playing in Europe and if you and we have the league cup over here and the FA Cup so we play so so so many games so if you are able to play all these games you need a big squat that seems to be fair to me and then one of the things is so important for a manager so to pick the first 11 is difficult but to tell someone that he's not even in the squad makes it even harder so I don't understand why we don't go to 23 in this country because this country plays the most games everywhere around the world and we only have 20 players uh that we can take to the game so it's not for that game because nine substitutes are more than enough but to keep the dressing room going um because you need more than 20 players in this country because we play so many games do you then understand what I mean yeah so it's not for this one game it's more as a team like us or Arsenal all the ones that play Europe you need more than 20 players so why can't we bring 23 players to the game instead of 20 but since it is the rule over here that is probably going to be the difficult most difficult decision I have to make for tomorrow not the first 11 um but to leave someone out that works so hard on a daily basis that wants to be involved in the game as well and not even taking him to the game that's the hardest decision for me to make yeah than thank you
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,7IJd7LDms6s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IJd7LDms6s,what was your view on the game it look like a real battle today it was as expected so I said before the game that after our home game when we were fre n up at halftime the way they came at as the second half I already knew what a great mentality this team has and um and quality as well and from that moment onwards they were they've done so well in the league and they've they've picked up points against so many good good teams not by luck but because they are intense they have quality uh and uh that's why we knew it was always going to be very hard and we and that we if if you want to win here maybe you need a bit of luck as well because the margins are so small our penalty was just not offside and their goal on 1-1 was on a margin offside they hit the post twice we had our chances as well but it was a close call uh for us to win this game you please the way that your players stood up to the physicality because there kind of be many games this season where it's quite so tough no no that's true you are saying so uh only a few only a few of them has been as stough like this and that's what I've told them before that um in all all the data uh data when when it comes to running they are so high up uh uh on the in the list so we knew that if we would have had any chance of a result over here we at least had to compete with them in terms of running and fighting and playing the jewels and all the these things and I think that's what the players did and um did today and yeah then having Mo Shala definitely helps uh in a game like this what was the situation with Trent the situation was that he uh said to me you have to take me off and he he he he sat on the floor and we took him off so he felt something uh I cannot tell you exactly what and how bad it is of course because we are one hour after the game but it's never a good sign if a player uh is asking for a substitution uh so I would be surprised but I this is not a fact but I would be surprised if he was If he if he plays On th day but um let's hope he's uh he's back with us as soon as possible for Alison as well he was so important again today two or three like absolute world class saves yeah like I said if you want to win here against a team that is so competitive you need uh you need a a team performance in work r that's what we have and you need some quality individuals that can make the difference for you and that goal of Mo was absolute quality and the saves Allison made as well but it was not only them just the way our center backs were defending again today was also impressive so uh team performance work rate incredible only way to have a chance for a result and then you need good individual performance and you need positive margins like I just explained with both our sides that were in our favor it feels like to maybe to The Outsiders of us the sort of game that title races swing on where as you say very fine margins for the bigger picture I think it's 15 games to go now yeah did it as someone who's played in those sort of teams in man how did it did it feel like that for you uh almost every game feels like this for me so um um we've we've had so many of our games have been tiling end exciting and uh uh there were a few moments already this season where I felt we're just not on on the right side so all the points we've got till now I think we deserve them I've said many times already the Chelsea game that's under debate and maybe and this game yeah we weren't unlucky let's put it that way but fulam at home being two two getting chance after chance United at home getting chance after chance at 22 and there was not a game that oh Forest that ended in the draw with us getting chance after chance in the end of the game so um yeah but what I want from them and what they want from each other is that they fight in every single game from the first till the last second to get the maximum result and that's what the fans expect from them playing for this club and that's what we try to do in every single game and that's also what necessary if you want to have any chance of a result in this league I noticed that Ryan gra was a bit more pushed towards the the right hand side today was that an intentional tactic from you what do you think I think it was is there any way you talk not many things that we do are just by coincidence so uh I think it's clear that um they have they have many good things this team um but uh their left fullback is definitely a threat going forwards and um mosella is an incredible player um but his main strength is not following the opposite fullback some people are laughing up here I don't know why that is but uh and I see a goal over here uh but that's not the only thing we want to keep Mo as much as we can forward as well because it is a risk for every team that plays us uh if if the left fullback goes I think it was what's game play I think one or two games ago um it was at home I don't exactly know which which game did we played last s did he score he had the first goal mo didn't he Post Yeah and and that was a moment where the left fullback just wanted to go forward and then Mo was free in transition and was a goal from Mo but so yeah it's clear that if you leave Trent constantly with seeno and KZ in the two F1 and that is not the best idea uh that I can come up with that's congrats on the winner I just wanted to get thoughts on that penalty decision in the first half there's been a lot of controversy about it online I just want to get your thoughts about it from who is the controversy online there's all always controvers so especially from fans uh that are probably not in favor of Liverpool the only thing I can say is and I haven't seen it back is that one of my players is on a clear 1 V one to the goalkeeper and he's falling down so either he makes his swba is that is that an English word as well swba a dive either he makes a dive it's a German word uh either he makes a dive or they touch him and if they touch him yeah then for me it's a penalty uh and if then it would not have even been a chance you're always like yeah is this really a penalty then but this was such a clear one-on-one chance that um yeah if he touched him which I assume he did otherwise the VR would have probably inter interfered and Kirk has impressed today a lot of people um is he a player that you'll be looking at in the summer I don't think uh I have to talk about uh players that are that we are interested in let alone uh a player from BMA he's playing over here he's having a great season as many many many other players here as well and that shows you probably how good of a manager you have over here and what a great Sports director you had over here and maybe still have I don't know how is the one doing now but he brought in very good players and and this manager works with them in an incredible way because he brings the best out of every single player including the one you just mentioned but I'm not talking about an individual they are all doing bringing the best out of their game at the moment that's just on the on the penal sometimes those are the sort of things you need to go for you is that is that almost like an element of the of the luck in invert comp you need to win games like this and to win titles ultimately uh I can come up with three four or five examples where we didn't had the luck we deserved or we didn't get the decision we deserved um but that's always the difficult thing in football if there's one then in your favor people will probably tell you ah there's always that luck of uh for for Liverpool or for the one that's that's number one at the moment um so yeah for me this has nothing to do with luck it's a clear One V one and I can tell you if Cody keko goes One V one to the goalkeeper it's quite a big chance as well yeah if you are done uh tripped it is a penalty and it's not like it's a penalty from a little push from a set piece and it wasn't even a chance so I wouldn't call this luck unless I see it back and I see there was he didn't touch him at all yeah then uh it was not luck then it was a wrong decision by the referee and the V but I assume that that was not the situation
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,TeMxVvev66o,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeMxVvev66o,H we'll start with a serious topic what do you make of the abuse that's directed referees that's been highlighted this week with online abuse to Michael Oliver and what responsibility is that for players coaches even the media as well to set an example yeah now we all have have a responsibility when it comes to this we are aware of that and um maybe not always we've been perfect examples but we are human beings as well but we try to uh be a responsible as possible the good thing in this country is the the atmosphere in in every ground we go to Every stadium is fantastic and that's not everywhere in Europe so I was um in Holland there's much more problems in and around the stadium than here in England so England was maybe the first country that has this under control hopefully we can we England can become uh now also the first country that has the online abuse uh an answer to that because um it's it's about referees but uh I think players get this and uh if if as a manager probably as well if you if you lose a few games so the social media thing is something we we we all uh are aware of and and hopefully like I just said uh we can get this in a way that this abuse is not there anymore but at this moment that's uh IR realistic I just wanted to ask you about moal as well because there's quotes from the Saudi Sports Minister today where he says we would love to have him which I don't think comes as any surprise to anyone given the numbers he's producing but looking at it from an objective point of view what would your advice be to someone like Mo over a move to Saudi when he's playing at the level that he is at the moment in terms of the numbers that he's producing yeah I would be surprised if there's anyone uh wherever around the world saying we don't want Mo we don't want moala so he's doing so well for so many years that everybody probably wants him and uh he's done so well without my advice for a long time so uh he can probably uh keep doing what is best for his career even without my advice but my advice to him would be different than than the one uh you just mentioned can you expand on that slightly then if your advice would be different no no what I mean with different is every everybody wants him including us we want him to extend of course as well so um yeah that is clear but uh I'm not surprised that s wants him but I'm also not surprised if would not be surprised if other countries won him as well so um yeah he's been old and wise enough he's done so many smart things in his career that he will make the right decision for himself and hopefully for us as well we will look at football because Bournemouth nine first team first team players injured 11 Premier League games though on beating nine goals in the last two games beating Newcastle and Notting Forest as well so how do you assess the challenge that you fac this weekend yeah that's a big one and this is probably going to sound strange and I I knew this already when we played the second half against them um in our home game we were 3-0 up at halftime and I was expecting a a second half where we could just control the game have the ball a bit and hope maybe score the fourth one but they just kept on going at us for 45 minutes and that showed me the character of the team uh and since then they've they've been outstanding uh they've were before that game also because we were F all up at halftime we didn't really match um the first half in my opinion maybe we deserve to be up but not with free goals and afterwards they've beaten so many strong teams and it's simple reason for that um a lot a lot of quality uh created by uh by Richard of course he created our our current Sports director who worked there for a few years and he hired a fantastic manager as well why is he a fantastic manager he has a great game plan and his players work incredibly hard and um and then in a different way than Arsenal they are also a threat and set pieces so where Arsenal nine out of 10 times does the same they always come up with worked ones that have been uh very useful for them as well so um in every Department uh a very good and strong team and they deserve to be where they are maybe maybe they even deserve a bit higher than the position they are at at the moment thank you and just following on from that I don't know how much you've maybe seen the career of Justin cver so far I mean 11 mil million euros and and look at the the development that he's had he's looking like an incredible bargain what what do you make of him as a player yeah he's one of the many examples uh where I think Richard deserves a lot of credit for but not only Richard the manager of course as well because he started working with him and uh you know that I believe that the team makes individual better so um yeah you need quality and that's what Richard brought uh there and his successor probably as well but um but I think most of the players that are there were there last season already as well and the manager has done an incredible job so um Justin great season he's having nice and good to see for us because we always knew he was a big Talent he left Holland quite early he was a bit criticized for that because in Holland many people always feel you need to have some extra years in a division before you go abroad but he's a great example that you can be really Successful by going abroad early and go to a few clubs and then at a certain age because I think he's only 24 he's not so he's not so old yet uh and be at this level already so um he will play another big talent that has grown up at ax uh Ryan graen so interesting uh interesting match up tomorrow um obviously you rested a lot of players in in the previous game we're expecting you'll make a lot of changes but how is the rest of the squad any other uh players coming back from injury Etc yeah you can say I rested a lot of players you can also say you played the ones that needed playing time um and I was really pleased how they performed in PSV and who were apart from three or four players that were not playing had a quite a strong team and we were more than competitive even the second half when all when there were so many youngsters on the on the on the pitch and the ones that stayed behind they um they didn't in the sense that they had three or four days off they did train but they didn't play a game and um I said already that doesn't give us any guarantees for Saturday but it hopefully will help us during the upcoming three or four months because it's uh the Premier League and the champions league is a long season for them with 10 10 months in a row non-stop playing games without any day weeks off in between so um hopefully that will help as them to stay fresh for the upcoming months that are coming ior um we saw Federico K play the 19 minutes uh against PSV every time he always seems to be really positive always wants to attack um how much of a threat could he be for the rest of the season and is he ready for more minutes in the Premier League as well if called upon yeah of course he's ready for more minutes in the Premier League because if you can play 90 at Champions League level then you are able to play uh an amount of minutes uh in in the Premier League his uh main problem if you want to call it a problem is that he's in competition with Lis Diaz Darwin Nunes Cody kako moala and Joo J and um I think you agree with me that they are doing quite well also uh but it's very good for us that it was six or seven months ago he said against Swiss when they lost in the Euros was his last time he played 90 minutes so it's very good uh from him but definitely also for a performance staff that we've during training sessions um um got him to the point that he's able to play 90 minutes without a lot of friendlies or whatever he has to play so uh big compliment for him how hard he worked and for the performance of medical staff as well I know you mentioned domic soas Li after the game last weekend but at the end of last season he was he was talking about the difference between the pace of the bunders league and the Premier League and he maybe set the bar himself too high and didn't form as well as he could have done in some games what have you seen from this season to you know to give you that kind of opinion that he can play that role for you this season now how well he's doing if he said what you said then I will talk to him today or tomorrow and say at this club you can never set the bar too high uh because that's impossible the bar at this club is of the higher standards and this what you have to uh where you have to get to so uh but probably he meant that he played some really good games and in football it's impossible to play if you play 60 games 60 games off of a certain certain level you can always go a bit lower that's normal but not too far and then we're talking about consistency and um and in this season he's done uh he's been very consistent in his work rate which is a main thing in football it's underestimated sometimes but I just highlighted why bornou is doing so well I think it's one of the reasons why we do so well also but he's not only working hard if he works hard the intensity he can run at uh the intensity he can play jewels in with is um is of the highest standards of this even of this level we are playing at so that's what for me stands out with him compared to many others uh the ability for him to run in a certain intensity and keep on running and I think what he is improving recent weeks or recent months is that he's more and more involved in dangerous attacks and sometimes in assists and goals in the last game he was involved in two goals so that is something he deserves because he's putting so much work in and his technique is also outstanding so I've I've never I've always felt that it's a matter of time before he would score goals give assists because um his shot his touch on the ball yeah he should he should he sh should set the standards High because he's a player that can reach definitely those standards hi um you've mentioned Richard Hughes he obviously played a big part in assembling this pouth side so have you spoken to him before the game and can you talk about how uh your relationship is with working with him yeah yeah I spoke with him before this game as I speak to him before every game and uh one day before the game two day three day four days we almost speak each other on daily basis uh and um of course uh I asked him a few things on bourou as well but um we have very good uh people that uh analyze uh warmouth and I'm doing this myself quite a lot as well I look a lot I see a lot of games of them already so it's just the more information you can get the better it is um but my relationship with him is very good which probably what you can expect if you win a lot of games because mostly relationships between managers and sports directors uh uh uh are a bit under uh debate if you start to lose a lot but um no my relationship with him is only very positive from start till now car um just to go back to the question you were asked about giving advice to Mo and I know you're not involved in transfers and and contract negotiations but have you express your thoughts to those three players that are out contract and some about where you see what what you want from them and where you see in the future I think you know the answer to this question don't you the answer is of course I speak with these players I speak with them not every day like Richard but quite a lot and it would be ridiculous if in all these times I speak to them we've never spoken about the future uh so of course uh we do but as you probably also know uh that's not something I'm going to discuss with you what we are talking about but um yeah but it's not only with the three that that are out of contract you also talk about future things with the other players as well so um it's a Non-Stop process talking to your players but it's also a Non-Stop process that I will not talk about that here in public with you just specifics on um timel J's return Joe Gomez is he ready to to the squad Dar both of all three of them uh are in training today um so then the question is are they already far enough to join us towards Bournemouth that's something we have to uh we have to wait and see today uh because we have probably also more than 20 players available we always have more than 20 available but but the ones that are mostly there so we have to make the smartest decision for them but also for for winning the game tomorrow hi you mentioned a few times there about how hard Bournemouth work and and the physical attributes have been to a game we know they've run more than anyone else in the Premier League how much is winning that physical battle going to go towards winning the game and how much did that influence your decision to rest so many players in mid week oh that that hasn't had any uh um there was no reason because we play bourou and they run so much uh to rest them during the week we would have done that against any other team that we faced because I already said it's not about we rested them not because of the B of game we rested them more for the long term because um if uh and it's quite a long time between November and March that there's an interational break and I have a week off but then I know Virgil I know because the Dutch team I know that they play two games against Spain so for them it just keeps on going and um that's why I've already also explained that if you look at our season after every three four or five weeks we've tried to create a moment where players like fil and all the others have played so many games didn't play during the week mostly there was a League Cup game uh that they didn't play so um was that answer to your question well how much the physical battle against a team like B who used those so well how much is that going to play towards winning the game yeah a lot a lot uh if you if you if you can't compete with with them in that aspect you have then you need luck to win the game and then you need a special moment or uh or um or a special save or a lot of special saves from Ali to win the game but if if we're able to compete with them on a physical level uh then the margins for us to have a chance to win to win the game go up a lot of course but if we cannot compete with them phisically which I think we definitely can because we are a team that's really fit as well I agree with you they're just above us probably also has to do that we have a bit more ball possession than them um but uh in I think it's one of the few games we've played this season that we were outrun only by a small margin but we were outrun against uh against bourou and um yeah I hope that uh that that's going to be different tomorrow is not going to be easy I made decision on whether James McConnell and Jaden D might be allowed to go out on low not necessarily if he will but if he would be allowed to interested that uh these are also ongoing uh discussions we have and um you know how it is in football uh yesterday can be different than today or tomorrow so uh if if I can give you a certain answer now and then of course we're not hoping that this is going to happen but if I then uh leave the training pitch and we are free injuries uh along along the training session then it's going to be be a different answer so it's a process we are we are discussing a lot about uh and these these decisions will be made uh will be pushed towards the end of the window which is almost there thank you next on
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,KOxBp0FH_Nw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOxBp0FH_Nw,like expected I think eventful game with many goals I think everybody expected that before the game um for two reasons maybe one of one of the one of the reasons I think two managers always want to press High want to bring the ball out from the back so sometimes you see them certain mistakes but it's always eventful uh and for the other reason because um both teams uh maybe made the hours was not playing in the setup that we usually do so then you see in some moments uh that we defend in a way what what probably is not expected if we play with all of our starters but still in the end we were able to uh definitely make it make a game out of it uh with all especially in end with all these youngsters on the pitch so eventful would be my word to use the first time that fed 90 minutes that like a big step forward tonight seems getting lot sharper yeah yeah and he got a knock with the penalty so uh that took him a few minutes before he kept going again but I think it's been seven eight or nine months ago maybe maybe even longer I don't know exactly that he played 90 it's the same for Jayden dance was the same for James McConnell so we had quite a lot of players that were not used to playing so many minutes in the last six or seven months so it's especially for them also important that they make these 90 minutes and were able to keep competing during 90 minutes uh okay Jaden couldn't manage to keep the play the whole game but federo in the end was still sprinting trying to do his work so positive yeah yeah it's crel but uh uh he's never played first team football yet and then to make your debut at the Champions League level is probably the hardest way of making a debut and um yeah I think he he he misinterpreted the situation yeah and that is uh immediately a problem at this level or a premier league level so it's uh it's a big moment for him to learn from um and it is cruel indeed you think in A Moment Like This 10 minutes before the end going to make my wut in the pre in not in the Premier League in Champions League and a few minutes later you go off with a red card that is always uh difficult but yeah a career mainly is not always positive it's there are also negatives and he has to fight very hard to make sure he will ever play a second Champions League game again which is not going to be easy but hopefully he will you think there's a chance any of the young players play might be allow to go out and Loan before the transfer deadline there's always a chance in life um and at the moment we have most of our players fit so um we will have this discussion tomorrow I think me and Richard about these players but there's definitely one of them that will not go on loan and I think you know which one I mean James McConnell I wouldn't say definitely but I like them a lot today so maybe now the end result of today is would be good for him to go somewhere and play but he is also some a player that hasn't played in the last six or seven months uh uh 90 minutes because he was injured for a while and he impressed me a lot today AR what taste does le result leave in your mouth um well in the beginning we lost this is not the reason why we came here for so it's a deception and um it's all about winning or losing uh well at the end it didn't have any effects on um the table or the competition but or what it meant for the next draw uh so yes of course it was a deception I saw some good things I also saw some goals conceded that I would like to see better but I'm sure that it's the other way around too that when PSV gave away that goal I'm sure that they weren't happy about it uh but this is football this is normal and it's good to see that some guys who didn't make 90 minutes in a long time were back today and they left a great impression some of the guys who make some minutes in the season uh also uh left a great impression so yeah well uh okay let's say only that okay did you calculate or did you think about this that she would expected this no I'm not going away with a bad feeling but it I do think it's a shame that we lost and I saw some positive things um when the game is finished I always say that we are looking into the next game I've done this all my career as a head coach maybe this was the first and maybe the only exception in my career that I was looking a bit more towards the next game like Bournemouth is coming up and there's all the focus on from now on what have you been talking about with p b because you both caused a lot of um spectacle and a great game uh now we just spoke about the draw that they could uh face or not get As I understood well and if he was right then they might get finer right or you am I right well I how's this possible it might be Juventus who knows final lost 61 is that true two injuries Justin and Santi o he went in been BL that you yeah no definitely uh I don't know if it's a big achievement but it's a good achievement to end up top of top of this league but I said many times it's so hard to judge a league table after eight games uh let alone if uh all the teams play different OPP opponents so um it doesn't tell me much to be honest um because some teams have faced easier opponents than others so um um but it's always nice if there's a new format that you end up number one but it U doesn't give us any assurances for for the next round because if I then now check the the league table and I see the four teams if I'm correct we can face four can we that's the difference between P which I don't completely understand but um we can we can face those four and those four are especially um um uh one of them is uh definitely the one you're hoping not to face if you end up first in a group like this J if you look at the goals conceded and goals one in front so let's say are you a fan of this new Champions League format or what can you tell me now it depends on what club you work as on this logo in front of me you would have said fard is were the trainer of fard I think they ended up uh 19 Well normally you would play in Europa League because the first 16 will continue in a tournament now you continue in Champions League for many clubs this is really great for us it means two more games and I mean Liverpool now so uh normally you would end up in the first two ranking so it depends on who you are asking um I I I don't think it's extremely fun but we'll see at the end of the tournament if we have won it maybe I talk about the tournament in a different way then but we have to wait for it will this be a night that you don't remember for that long I guess no there have been matches against PSV that I will recall for a longer time than this one just over James McConnell we have uh uh that we're not even here but he's always a very competitive player so I'm not surprised but you always wonder how you're going to react on this stage at this level uh um we saw the same with Amar nello which is not a player that has the same impact in training session yet as James McConnell but that Jame just plays and is competitive is not a surprise but he definitely deserves credits for his performance today last one no the last one is always f it okay yeah I've missed him a bit so uh uh 50% chances of PSV playing finor you can always explain really well why should we be proud on Dutch Football that this is going to happen or what's your opinion sorry uh other games will be PSV playing Juventus or the other facing a Milan well PFE already played ju right is that uh yes I yes I know well what do we hope for as a Dutch Football well by saying nothing that you know my answer or maybe not maybe one team in the eight as a Dutch team you don't want to compete to can for playing for uh the Dutch team I think it's a cheap way to score but when I was playing in UEFA cup um I visited these games if I not playing PV it was big games in spectacular results I think it was three two also ended up in penalties so so do you still recall the penalties of an hoyon but in general uh you always um prefer to play youu or Milan so let's say that we are hoping for that this is a telegraph Dutch Telegraph this is do you do you do you accept this you're not getting the last question saaru in by the they talking about making a transfer to Premier League how do you see their potential and their possibilities to end up in playing in Premier League I don't know if it's uh too nice to talk about two specific players but what you can say is that the Dutch competition has showed that players can be successful in preion League too the biggest example Cody kako were playing today for us and I think that first goal that bakay Yoku made the scored it was a great goal and um I can imagine that PSV as a team as there have some players that are in the aim of other bigger team so I think they even reached the last 16 last tournament who did they beat I don't remember now one phe earlier they they continues in a tournament though but um that's a beautiful team to play for so uh um they decide when they are ready to make this step and um we cannot say that some players are not going to play in a higher level because I'm sure that they will
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,P-ucCBtEy28,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-ucCBtEy28,[Music] o [Music] [Music] [Music] that's okay and uh hands up if you'd like to ask i' like to go first hi um are you happy to be back here in Holland yeah of course um I'm happy in England uh I'm happy at in Liverpool uh with the team with the training ground and everything that comes with that but um I've I've had a great time here in Holland uh football-wise but definitely uh in my private life as well so it's always nice to be back uh not at the club I'm supporting uh but um but nice to be back and uh speak a bit of Dutch once in a while as well and you've obviously left quite a lot of the senior players at home you could just explain the reasoning behind that and how excited are you to give some younger or Fringe players a chance to prove themselves tomorrow yeah uh they don't need to prove themselves we know what the quality is for the players that um that we going to play tomorrow but um I think um we are playing like all the teams in Europe many many many games and um these players already so all the ones that are left behind could have played tomorrow but for the long term so it doesn't tell you anything about the short term so it doesn't tell us anything about the Saturday game but for the long term if you look back at our season it's been almost every time after three or four or five weeks we gave them the break during the week uh when it was a League Cup or an FA Cup if there was a moment for them to get some freshness back we've always done that and um it took me a while to understand this new format but um I always say when I think I'm 100% sure I use 99.9 but now I can say I'm 100% sure that it doesn't matter at all if we end up one or two because we will play 14 15 16 or 17 and then in the end it's a draw which of the teams we are going to face so um this is a game for us because we're now number one or two we Cann drop to number three that has no importance of result coming to the league table but a very wise man once said to me I've never seen anything good coming from losing a football game so we are not going into the game tomorrow um trying to lose the game we will do everything we can trying to win it of course and second thing is uh because that was part of the story uh that um because we mainly start with 13 14 players that have shared most of the playing time the ones that haven't played a lot it's very useful for them to have 90 minutes because if we do get into injury problems these players will have a bit of game Rhythm then as well so it's uh it's a choice that we've made for the long term doesn't tell you anything about the results in the short term but definitely it helps us for the longterm uh in English here you want AR what do you think of the season of PSV and how they play this season uh compared with last season when you were in Holland than playing against them yeah of course last season I saw a bit more than uh than this season and last season they were incredible um this season I didn't I haven't seen that much I think I think they've dropped a few points more than last season uh but not that big of a difference so they are still a team if they if they um yeah Al so I go to Dutch now is that okay you still score a lot of goals in short amount of time so they still have a lot of quality in their squad so if you talk about team something has changed there little familiar to your philosophy you like it and talking about Peter boss he also likes your philosophy playing football are any similarities many many many many coaches uh what is definitely a similarity he wants to have the ball a lot he doesn't go to low block waiting for the other team to make a mistake he doesn't let his goalkeeper put the ball on the six yard line and kick it as far as he can he wants to bring the ball out from the back so um I think for the PSV fans uh and and I've noticed this when I was here last season but they are really really really happy that Peter is here because uh he doesn't only bring results every every game he's involved then it's I think it's a joy to watch it's always positive it's always eventful a lot of things happen so um I think the fans here in oven are not only because he won the league very happy uh mainly also because of his playing style and I know we are mainly judged about results but I would I would hope that there comes a time that managers always also judged on their playing style which is difficult because almost every everyone judges us if we win we play well if we lose we don't play well thank you from in Dutch or in English you can do Dutch in Dutch you can do Dutch I I only have one question for you please go ahead continue There was a wise man told you during your career that things are going well a lot of players that have time to play does this give you more confidence that you have so many players who are able to play or is it also bit scary to switch that amount of players and change them do it scare me is the question if I this happens um no maybe both I don't maybe both because I don't think in football that you can think for the past few months it has been going very well so then we are convinced that it will be going well in future as well we cannot do so especially because when you're in full in the team and I've said this also during my time at fire it's so difficult to become a champion and some people are watching my uh the outside say it has would have been easy no there are many things that need to go well that you need to perform well and some things that I always mentioned at fireart is that I felt that 10 times a day you need to throw the dice and six has to roll out so to be successful um yeah you have to perform it doesn't give you any guarantees it doesn't give me any um more than confidence than other I wouldn't say that I'm scared neither because when you're in this this job uh tomorrow we play PSV then Bournemouth and then Tottenham I don't remember uh what will happen League Cup FA Cup and after that another game during the week uh so I especially working on PSV and bment and this is um exceptional because normally I would only work on uh PSV but yes I'm looking into the match against Bournemouth as well will the players who stay behind train tomorrow or are they off and have you left any staff members behind to help them no no there will be off tomorrow if if there's a possibility uh if it's possible we always prefer to have them off three days before the game that's not always possible if you if you play so many games but they will train on first day so there will go a few staff members back home earlier Thursday morning uh to train with the ones that stay behind uh on Thursday but they're off tomorrow yeah we'll switch to Dutch just to make it easy now that you are back in Holland did you receive a lot of messages uh people saying hello to you but I was wondering if your biggest critic person did you invite him your father no I don't receive any message of the people who are here but uh I don't know if this is normal in football but I didn't receive any messages from you guys but yes I received a lot of messages in general not only uh this week but the last few months my father will not be here he says that he can watch much better when he watches the television he sees many more things uh and uh he's from Buren time the village where Arn SL was born and what I don't miss in the Netherlands is the amount of traffic that we have in this country so I don't think that he had to drive 2 and a half hours but much longer than that so I don't think it's that strange H so I don't think that he will be watching with too many neres from the couch at home in Dutch besides the fact that you performing so well in Champions League how do you look at this new stage tournament this new setup for many times I have said that at the end of the tournament you can only judge or talk about uh how this champions league setup has changed and maybe if you look at the teams that are now on 16 17 18 spot maybe some um clubs change like Celtic man uh so sometimes you've uh played six or seven games and you won and then you hope that this will give you a prize but but well we have to hope that this is still the case but in the past some other clubs who performed uh worse and still continue during the uh champions league and now we can see that there's still a playoff phase and that they are able to reach further in the tournament so if you ask me as a coach on this team as a a club coach from a club who worked at somewhere where it wasn't that easy to continue in a tournament well and and I think for them it's even better because now I just I ask myself if it's a bad thing to end up 16 17th in this setup so if I would say that everybody will continue I if I say all eight clubs will continue how many 8 12 uh yeah well then it's a lot [Music] right AR they declared you almost as a saint do you sometimes watch yourself in a mirror when you're brushing your teeth what's it like to be arest SL when I you look at the mirror well it's not always that Pleasant I have to confess to be a bit self-criticism here and self spot to use I wish I had a little bit more hair for example but no as a head coach I'm not looking at the things that uh people were quite positive about me when I worked at F or but it gives you a certain pressure to perform for the next games people expect that working at fire or you end up uh first in the table so no you're not uh dealing with the press all day and what people write about you but what you can do and what I was doing is um doing the things that you can influence on and we have to work hard for that but me and my staff as well uh we always want to prepare as best as possible because tomorrow and the D again against the bourou there's a little space between the games uh so um yes I look myself in the mirror but not that many time because I'm just working hard your decision to leave players at home you already explained a little bit but have you also thought about bringing in the best players and to perform with your team because this is your squad is this something that you're dealing with to to show yourself no no no I'm not dealing with what my team is like because I want to win no I'm dealing with my team I'm looking into the long term of this process of the group management and I think that the group that we bring on the pitch tomorrow is great and it will be strange if uh tomorrow the group is has the same level as we would have in other games um but still we will have a team that uh when they play in a league cup they would be able to win against South and I think Brighton that we had in League Cup H it wasn't that easy by the way but we did win and um as you seen after me Cody kak will be here so I decided to bring him for example so yes uh I do think about some sentiments or feelings that go here but have you seen that he didn't play against Le last week for the ones here in the room who are sharpened did you see did you notice now that you're back do you have moments in which you consider and think about your time and look back and reflect on your time have you ever imagined what it would be like to win this amount of games and to perform this well I've received this question many times I am never dealing with where I will be in six or S months the only way that I work is how can I bring in my style of play as soon as possible with this team the reason that the club ended up with me is because of my there were so many characteristic that I shared between the game of style of Jan klopp and mine and some personalities that's the first focus and after that the draw was clear for Champions League I was hoping that o i don't hope that the last game of this uh Champions League will be still important because uh more than some of the English journalists here um uh in the room are still knowing that it will be really difficult to to play here or at fire nor because it brings the best players who perform here so as a group I'm happy to be in the position that we are in now um thanks to this new format of the Champions League it doesn't matter if we win or lose tomorrow so yes I'm happy but please the differen is between England and Netherlands we all can see the difference in quality or intensity but can you mention please another difference that we might not think but you have to see this a relatively way because in general there are many more players in England than in the Netherlands because there is more money to spend of course but uh only half year ago yish and cber in the Dutch national team they were higher in the EUR so I wouldn't say that the players from PSV are much having less quality than the Dutch national team or that we have for example but if you compare to the Dutch a divis Dutch league and in the Netherlands you would say the right side of the table and in the lower side of that part in the table if you look at one player who maybe could play in ax P fard and if you look at England I think every team has one or two teams that could play or that has been bought for a lot of money that could also have happened at a top club so they to win uh game in Premier League and away game or even any game is a bigger challenge because not only they have better players but also the managers uh are well I have to say they're really good so each game this is makes a bigger Challenge and the program fin was similar because we played every three games but I think that if we have two or three more games and fin right I'm guessing and I think that's about it but to play against striker of our last game who did we Face who did we face last game ah iwi sign okay well to play against the striker or west time it's tougher to play against than you look at the striker of AR the Dutch team here in the uh the intensity of the jewels that you face are so much heavier here in England than in the Netherlands then is going to play there but now I'm in the Champions League think of their season these are a lot of questions in one of course I do follow them I follow the ear fish but less intense or and I see less than I used to do or I used to see yes I follow them and what was your second question well not that extremely because I of course saw the game against by MIT because we faced them also but we play at the same time so so I didn't see that many games of fire or and the last one How does it go with fire or well I guess you can say this also they're doing great in Champions League and I am supposing that in uh they were wishing to perform better in the Dutch league but this is my idea this is the reality now that they are facing Arn welcome back you are saying my father is not in the stadium did you receive another message or invitation from others to arrange some uh tickets for the game tomorrow did many people want to come tomorrow no not that many people my family is here and um my brother or I don't know if it's always like this but when we uh want the ticket for Liverpool they sometimes need to be uh sitting in the stand of the opponent's team in the stadium of Liverpool so these are the only requests that I received um and after the week some more people were interested but then they asked the what they were the first 11 to plays in and what I was thinking but then the interest of the team became less and less from my family but I still think that the Liverpool fans are looking forward toward this game because it's a beautiful game to play and we still bring in good players than you [Music] [Music] [Music] we'll take um questions in English just let it know if you're going to ask in Dutch and we'll get the translation in Cy what's it like to be back in the Netherlands played for many years here it's a beautiful moment special moment for me of course I'm looking forward to be on the pitch tomorrow have you mentioned the coach that I will be going with you tomorrow what did you say no but I do think that the coach uh felt the same way that he knew that I wanted to be part of the team playing here what can you tell us about the guy who left here two years ago and the guy who we see here today I think I grew up a little bit I more mature um bit older more experience in my legs I think this is the biggest difference all your family will be here tomorrow yes I do think so yeah thank you be welcome back what do you expect do you have any idea what you can receive of the fense tomorrow um I haven't heard anything I hope that I will get a positive uh moment tomorrow and that people receive me quite personally I think that I've always had a great bond with the fans with the club and I'm looking forward to see them all what will happen if you score a goal will it cheer what will your reaction be like I don't think that I will cheer that much because I'm so thankful and I thank so many things uh to this club and uh I don't think that I will be too enthusiastic we read many stories about you one of your first coaches the amateur team who saw you when you were seven years old he said that you were looking in You Had Your Eyes On The World what kind of boy did you become playing for PSV that's a good question I think that I always was a guy willing to learn eager to learn always looking to learn more and this is also thanks to PSV I also read the something about players Tribune last season you couldn't bring what you wanted last season something you said in the Press but now I think the group is bigger and better but do you feel it yourself is it more comp did it become more competitive the group I think that last season we had the period in that we had many injuries and then of course the squad decreased this didn't help of course and some of the players um came back without their form or their shape but we were still in an important period of the league so all happened at the same time in a bad moment but now we do have a group that is fit in form in shape with a lot of quality and I think that it makes us stronger one more question one moment you had your substitute last game and right straight away the coach said something what did he say on the sidelines Oh you mean when I got substituted or when I had to go off the pitch well the coach said that also it was because of the game coming up this game so that hopefully I could also play against PSV as a captain no I don't think there are some other players who can also uh who are also here and who also deserve to be a [Music] captain a coule will it how strange will it be to walk out at this Stadium as the away player tomorrow night like how odd will that be for you um yeah pretty strange I think I I never been in the away dressing room so it will be my first time so uh yeah and also on the other side of the the walkout so yeah different than I was used to but um yeah when the game will start I think all those things will will fade away and we all will be focused on the game and uh with the team we have we are here and we are going for the win so yeah hopefully it will be a good game just um on the slot you you always seem to play on that left wing role whereas last season you used to have to play a bit as number nine are you much happier there and you seem to be playing some of your your best football there yeah I think uh before before I played on Central Striker I played as a left Winger so I I always have been a left Winger and uh now I'm yeah back where I play at my best I think so happy Cody U what type of reception are you expecting tomorrow from the home fans sorry you been asked this already in Dutch and also with the slot rest and a lot of um the regular players were you given that opportunity and but did you say that you wanted to come here and play um so your first question uh yeah hopefully uh a good reception uh from the fans I think I always had a good connection with them um so yeah I'm looking forward to see them again tomorrow and uh on your second question um yeah but I uh I I got the the question from the from the manager as well but uh I didn't play uh one minute against Le uh last week so also with um from the manager's point of view that I probably would like to come over here and get some minutes here so yeah that's why I'm here actually any more Chris just um sorry if this has being asked in Dutch because but what do you think the biggest differences uh this season to last in terms of you were in a very similar position going for four trophies I think you mentioned your plays tbun until the last 10 games it was going well what what do you think the biggest lesson you've learned that can help the te this season so it's different well I I think the biggest differ is at this point I think last season we had a lot of injuries what I what I just said as well uh in Dutch um and obviously I think Mo was also away for the Africa Cup so that didn't help as well uh he injured himself over there I think even um and then we had I think Darwin was out with his hamstring uh Dominic was out Curtis was out um Trent was out out Trent was out as well so J was out as well so Ali was out Ali was out as well so we had uh we had some problems last year which didn't help um uh this year uh at this point almost everybody's fit uh so we are hoping that we can keep it this way and we can keep going do you think that the belief is is much even more now as well because You' had that extra year as a team together as well that's really yeah obviously uh a year has gone by and then as a team as a group you get more experience you get more togetherness as well so um yeah I think we we were growing last year and we are growing this year as well so uh hopefully we can bring uh uh bring it to a good end thank you last one please Cody Cody what's the biggest difference that AR slot added to this team and what do you think that his uh biggest plus point or B biggest positive point that he brought in I think that in ball possession we Face these games in a different way I think that we play more on ball possession in some periods during a game we prefer to maintain ball possession and create after that a bigger occasion and we also try to break how to say so the opponent and this helps us so when we lose the ball ball possession we still have the energy and to play high pressure again and to get the ball back and it all starts again I think that also tactically speaking this is the biggest strength that we now face or encounter our opponents and we all like this do you still look at PSV do you follow them what do you think of the Season yes I still follow them I try to watch the games they first I believe Four Points above the second team I think they're doing well yes of course um well if you look at the last games if I remember well they lost they had a strange game for the cup Dutch cup uh in between but they still won so yes at the end I think the most important thing is that if they continue on this way that they are doing well so that they this is what I hope thank you thank you all [Music]
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,GwVHz4IVVOo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwVHz4IVVOo,Frank said after the weekend that you're a level above Manchester City you're a level above Arsenal went on to say probably also the best team in the world which I suppose is easy to say when you six points clear at the top of the Premier League and Three Points clear at the top of the Champions League standings as well but what do you think are you the best team in the world at the moment um his opinion means definitely something to me because uh he's shown at um at brenford how well he's done uh so many years for this club and uh uh without spending crazy amount of money just every time he's able to perform with his teams very good in the Premier League and make it so hard for every top five to top six team to play against them so his opinion definitely means something to me but I think it's far too too early for me to say these things we have to face a lot of teams Champions League former this season is is also difficult can we judge the league table in the Champions League because every team faced different teams so you can be lucky or not uh with the draw you had I don't think we were lucky though but uh so very difficult to judge uh the league table but always nice to get compliments from a manager that has proven to be such a good manager here in the Premier League can I ask you again about Darwin as well because everyone saw how happy the rest of the group was that he got those two goals at the weekend as well but as you admitted on Saturday he could have been sent off as well as a coach do you quite know know what you're going to get from Darwin all of the time and how do you manage that uh I'm almost happy that you asked me this question because he would have been sent off sent off after the 2-nil so that not everybody is saying that's why they won and they were lucky blah blah blah no I can come up with a few uh a few decisions that went against us where we didn't get the points maybe but uh let's not get into that um so then your next question was because I only want to focus on that no I mean do you quite know what you're going to get from Darwin all the time and how do you manage that uh I think it's with with uh the the most difficult in football is to find for for a team but also as an individual to find consistency and um um only a few players in the world uh are able to be at the same level every three days in a row and then there's a big big big group of players that are able to play very good many times but not every single time and um it's not it's it's I think we have uh he's one of the one of the players that belongs to the group that is good many many many times but next step for him would be nice if he can go into the bracket of the five six seven or eight players in the world that are every every three days outstanding and I do know we have also one or two uh or few players that are every three days of a very high standard and it's a nice challenge for him to go to that group of players as well and you can pretty much secure top spot in the Champions League standings With Victory I mean what importance do you put on finishing top of those Champions League standings before the The Knockout phase nah the most important thing every time we go out there especially in front of our own fans we want to win a game and uh with this new setup you you think you think that ending up number one is the best position to end up with but because it's such a strange League table because uh for example I'm I think I'm right if I look at pan J every every week I think they have the hardest uh Team to face uh so they are quite low on the table which is not their quality but they are low so maybe if you end up number one you can face them so then it's a disadvantage so I'm not looking at a lake table in a way of oh if we are number one we probably have the most easy uh Team to face because that is UN unpossible to impossible to say because of this weird format or weird I don't mean it in a negative way but it's strange format we are having now so um being on top maybe doesn't tell you that you're the best team and being number 24 doesn't tell you that you're number 24 in terms of quality it's a lot of um has to do with the with the teams youve faced so yeah we want to win but not from an idea about yeah that will probably give us then the best lead up for the rest of the campaign Mone that what do you think I'm I'm going micophone please sorry sorry from what do you think of Le performances so far in this Champions League are you surprised by the way they play and the teams they've beaten I'm impressed not surprised but impressed uh not surprised because I think it was two or three years ago that I played uh the current manager when he was at Ren uh with my former club uh and then I was impressed by the way his team played and um yes of course uh a few weeks ago when I didn't saw them playing yet I was like o they beat attico Madrid uh surprise they beat Real Madrid surprise but uh now uh of course I saw many games of them and now I'm uh definitely not surprised anymore but impressed because they've deserved every single point they got till now and I just said something about the league table for them it's definitely not because they faced uh uh uh easy competition they faced Sporting Lisbon when amarine was still there and they were impossible to beat sporting lisban okay they lost that one but uh they faced them they faced ju they faced Atletico Madrid they faced Real Madrid and now they are facing us and the next game is going to be difficult for them as well because then they face Fino which is my former Club if you didn't know uh so they haven't been lucky with um with the fixtures they had so that that's the reason why I'm so impressed with with um with them in the champions league and an unbeaten run of 21 games probably tells you even more that's that James hi Anna um you've mentioned a few times about the the strange League table in the Champions League I wonder do you think this new format has been a success in terms of revamping the champions league and maybe does it show that there's a far more even spread of quality in in Europe than perhaps we thought previously I said many times already because almost every game you play Champions League you get this question about what what are your experiences about the new format it's difficult to judge uh as long as as as the season is still going I think one of the one of the positives is especially for the teams that are in uh pot three and four that they also face teams from their own pot but the way you say it from your own uh yeah so uh and that gives them a bigger chance of course to win games so in in the old format it was one two three four and as a pot four team you always faced three two and one so it was not always easy to win a game and now they have two games against equal opposition as well so uh for those teams I'm 100% sure they feel uh it's a step up uh for the teams that were always in part one I have to wait and see uh to give you another honest opinion what I what I would prefer uh but what I've said and that's what I mean you cannot judge the league table and say okay this is the best team in Europe this is the second best team this is the third best team because we haven't played against the same teams and uh in a draw that's in the FA Cup League Cup that's in every draw you can be lucky or you can be unlucky with the draw you have and uh that's why it's easier to win a cup competition and to win a league because you can have the advantage of a lucky draw p AR um you've been very clear that performance levels have been improving and certainly attacking output has increased specifically over the last couple of months what what do you put that down to why why is that is well uh no I think I said that our our performance that so in terms of running have increased especially in the brenford game because it was was a tough game because brenford is is is a team that's really fit as well one of the reasons why they're so successful uh you tell me now that our attacking stats have gone up uh probably true I think we've scored more goals in the last five six seven eight nine games than we did before but we've conceded a few as well so we needed these goals maybe more than in the beginning of the season um so I don't I don't really see an argument where I can come up with why that has changed the only thing I can say is that we are working long together uh with the team and uh we we know even better what we want when we have the ball but we also need to know better what we want without the ball but we do concede more so uh it's not always a straight line going up or going down it's always a bit like this and I just wondered do you think the team's got a lot of confidence from the WIS against Bay lusen and and Real Madrid because they they were the German Champions the Spanish Champions and holders of the of the of the Champions League do you think that the team Grew From those those games yeah my answer is then always the same we are here you were here at the press conference from Liverpool so these players are used to winning big games so I don't think they need games like this to grow in self-confidence from okay we can beat these teams now all of a sudden I do understand that last season in the Europa League we weren't we were not in the Champions League so we didn't the club didn't face the same competition maybe as you as you have in the Champions League but the years before and at their uh national team uh and playing in the Premier League these these players are not impressed by a win against livero or a win against Real Madrid that's not something special for them they've done that so many times that they're they like it and they're happy with it but I don't see anything five minutes after the game I I already see like oh I can see I'm at Liverpool here because if we would have beaten with final at Real Madrid then there was a big party in the dressing room but here everybody's 5 minutes later already thinking about recovery and um and making sure that they're ready for the next game hi sh from AFP um going back to L and um their manager what are their main strengths for you and are you expecting a low block or maybe a more open game tomorrow uh it is difficult for me to answer that question because uh many managers have changed their game plan against us compared to the games they've played before uh in the last few months uh but if I just look at them how they've played against in the last last games and what their playing style is I'm expecting an open game tomorrow because they are pressing every team if it's Olympic Mariah or Real Madrid or whatever team they face they just pressed them high they are not afraid to bring the ball B out from the back so for us it's going to be a change of styles compared to the reason uh reason teams we faced although brenford also wanted to press us really high but also afterwards went to a real low block uh but many teams uh the fre or four teams we faced before didn't want to bring the ball out from the back um and that's what Li is doing that's what they're really good at so that's what I expect but I expected that from some from a few teams we faced in the last three or four games as well but they changed their game plan against us so you have to ask their manager if he's planning to play the same style or are you planning to change it and hi Anna I know I know it's not the most important thing to you but uh having the only 100% records in the Champions League now is that a badge of honor for you and for the team and a and a motivation to keep it going until the end as well yeah definitely not that we've had them but it is a motivation that we want to keep it going till the end uh we want to we want to win every single game we go out there um but it's not because of um we just want to end top eight and uh we need we know we need a point for that but this team has never gone out uh playing for a point um there was just a second ago a question about what I expect from De I expect something and you guys know what you can expect from Liverpool and that has been in every single play game we've played if we've been at Old Trafford or at Arsenal wherever we played we've tried to play their own style uh and we've never adapted the style sometimes in small details but never the style of High Press of bringing the ball out from the back and do the things we are good at so um so yeah that's what we want to try to do tomorrow again we we always play for a win and that's also what we're going to try to do tomorrow but we know know the difficult challenge it is because of the quality and the form Li is in James P Anna do do you know yet um the situation with Yogo obviously missed the weekend how long you expect it to be without him and how how close is Joe Gomez to coming back into the f um maybe jot a bit earlier than Joe and both of them are expected to be there back with us uh uh in weeks not in months so um but I've said many times before that the large last stage of rehab is the most uh difficult one or the one that can sometimes add a few days or not uh but it's uh clear that we are expecting to to be back with us in the upcoming weeks but it's always difficult to to say exactly how long it is but both of them are not going to be out for once that's for sure as long as the reap goes as planned of course what is the Yogo done he overloaded a certain muscle a bit well just ask about Gran gra Bas he started every champions league and Premier League game this season the second half of the season is managing his minute it's going to be important given that you haven't got someone like for like to come in and replace him oh maybe we don't have someone that is exactly similar to Ryan but I think that is almost for all of them so uh Dom is unique in his own way MO is unique in in his own way we have of course Cody kako but I don't see him similar to Lucho similar position but not similar style of player so every player we have is unique in his own way is Ryan for Ryan is the same thing but and we have players like wat who can play the Maka can play he played there against forest in the last half hour and even Curtis Jones can play there but um there's always a balance if you play them a lot and all of a sudden you drop points you play them too much and uh if they keep doing well everybody's saying Yeah the secret to esses that they always play with the same uh and I've said many times already it's not about playing at 125 it's not about these things it's about the competition you face and do we play toour standards but I understand that to make it a bit more simple for everyone to understand it's about they play too much or too little that is something we accept Carl the front with Joo being out for a few weeks still you say is is this the opportunity Darwin needs for a bit of a longer running the team on the back of the confidence he got from the weekend I don't think it's the first time that uh that uh that he's in a situation like this even this season he's been in a situation like jot has been out when uh when in the Chelsea game someone uh hit him so hard that he was out for five six seven eight weeks I think so that was similar moment and I know from the past that he's had long run of games with yugan as well uh and um but he is uh probably as you guys say in a good place now because he scored two and um so yeah of course it's simple uh at the moment we've got four attackers that are top fit and able to start the game and Darwin is one of them and then the fifth one is is fedo and the sixth one is he's not ready to start 90 yet in my opinion uh but he's coming closer and closer to uh to be able to do so the reason why he isn't because he hasn't had many minutes yet so it's not about him it's about me not giving him so many minutes so that's difficult for him then all of a sudden go from 5 minutes to 90 minutes um so yeah that increases the chance for Darwin of course to get more playing time if one of the six is is injured and especially if it's a number nine well hi Anna uh yeah you mentioned there that K is still not quite at his level to be able to start 90 minutes and obviously Liverpool were very cautious with Diego jotto and trying to make sure he didn't come back too soon and yet he still managed to break down does that situation mean you're more likely to be even more cautious with Federico or do you think it's not necessarily one affecting the other no not one affecting the other every every player is unique in its own way and everyone has his own background which I mean the jot had a had a normal preas or not normal because he was at uh Euros I think they were in the summer yeah uh so he didn't have a long preseason but he had a normal start with us where fed Rico didn't uh fed Rico was a few times in lucky with when when moments were there for him to play that he was Ill or sick uh and then I think we all also saw how difficult it is with jot is a great example of that if a player has been out for five six or seven weeks to bring him back to that load of playing every single game 60 to 90 minutes you have to be really careful with that if you don't want to go into another injury and um yeah especially because there's no winter break there's no time to give them during the week again unless I have to play them with the under 21s but I don't think a player like fedo K Joo J should play in those games so that makes it hard if a player was injured to bring them back and some players are so clear starters for me I just give them their first minutes uh uh in the first team one of them is coming immediately after me IU K play five weeks out played immediately against United because he's such a vital part of our team but unfortunately for fedo uh he has Mo Salalah in front of him so he's not he doesn't have the similar status or hogi as um as iok Kon had so that makes it hard for us to build them up in the right way but I'm happy that he had a good uh good 30 to 45 minutes against akans and Stanley and um although it was five minutes he was part of the team that scored two goals and he was really happy happy with it what I saw as well welome thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] wonder how you all felt for Darwin on Saturday his first Premier League goals since the nth of November and that obviously put you six points clear at the top of the Premier League now no honestly I'm very happy for him I know he worked very hard uh to be there to have this moment and we know we need that with since the start of the season and especially because I remember the game before in Forest I told him because he was suspend I said to him we really need you in this game and he was laughing and what happened last game is just what I said to him and he was very happy here for yourselves as well it was the first clean sheet in the games that you've been involved in since you returned from injury uh how did it feel to get that clean sheet and and how do you feel now do you feel that you're at full match sharpness or is it a bit of a way to go still no for me especially because I'm a Defender and for every Defender this team it's very important for us to to have a clean sheet and we have done this and I hope this will keep going and uh me yeah I I try to to come back really 100% but I'm not because uh I Rush my comeb back with my knee but uh I've done this for my team and uh I can die for this team then it's fine and my new will come back really 100% very soon it's fine does that mean you still having the aition I still have pain sometime but I I play with pain killer and it's enough for me to play you're not worried about it at all I don't have to think about that I just have to to think about to play and this will go go away soon just finally then what importance do you put on finishing top of the Champions League standings now because you have the opportunity effectively with a win to secure that tomorrow night yeah for sure this is one of our Target to finish in the top of the champions league but uh this will start tomorrow again because we play against l l it's a very good team and we have to be ready because uh they will come here to make a result against us and uh we will try to have ch on tomorrow hi I want to speak in French so you should be okay you should be okay okay if I speaking FR yeah I just wanted to know what you would think about Le do you know any the players are you close to any of the players at Le well close not really I don't really know a lot of the Leo players I know the goalkeeper uh because um he was in the national team last time around but um high quality team they've been a quality team for a long time you just have to think about other players who've um been at Le who've left Le in the meantime got some friends who've been at Le and so they have a regular supply of good players um I know what to expect tomorrow I know that they're going be coming to anfield to get a good result absolutely I think we need to be ready we need to be fully focused right from the very um kickoff right through to the end of the game just is it injury did you have to convince the Medics here that you would wanted to play and and was that as soon as you seen Joel get injured you realized I need to get back here no honestly I was very close to came back anyway the plan was for me to to train on this week but uh when I saw Joe with his injury I was like okay I have to to come back really quick and don't really think about uh my knee for sure the first game I feel it little bit but the pain go get better day after day than uh it's fine it's enough for me to play and to have a great game as well physios and the Medics they were like happy with you Are You Bing yeah for sure for sure not the physio the medical staff have done a very good great job for me and uh every day I spent I don't know how many hours at the club every day when I was injured and uh I was very happy and I thanked them with some cookies to be behind me and no have done a very good job and they will never take a risk with me it's the it was very me who was ready to to play but like I said I play with a little bit pain but it's enough to to play and to be ready as well you close to signing your new contract the club open the club open talks with you in in a few months ago what was the latest not who talk about that few months ago the club didn't say anything I didn't say anything it's one person said that and I was not ready I didn't know when he said that but after I spoke with the club but uh I think I'm really focused on what happened now and uh we will see what will happen so have you been off of the deal yeah yeah and are you close to signing this is another conversation any no hi uh you're in your full season here as a Liverpool player and you've managed to score five goals in that time now this is a team that's got lots of set pieces you had a really good chance in the game as brenford do you think this is an important part of developing as a player to be able to be a threat in the opposing box as well as really good in your own box yeah for sure for sure this is very important especially for a Defender we want to clip sh clean uh always and yeah like you said I scored five goal and I really hope more because my target this Ison what to score four goals I have two left and uh if tomor against score will be very very happy but the more important now it's to have a win with a clean sheet and oh my God it's okay it's not important e like Mo said there you're in your fourth season out the club and I think earlier this season you captained France just wondering how much you feel your growing in responsibility within this group and do you really feel like you're becoming a leader now within the group are in the group of Liverpool or Liverpool yeah yeah I remember I came I came in this club when I was 21 I was a really young and the player around me was older than me and uh I think I grew up in every situation like uh like a human like a player and I take a lot of experience and I think the club help me a lot to be the capit of uh the French Squad and uh yeah it's a great moment it was a great moment for me but uh it's just a start and I just have to work hard to to be in this way CH May did you think your partnership with Virgil is probably the best in Europe at the moment this Ison yeah I think so yeah yeah what is it about the that you compliment each other so well what you think it is how is it playing alongside the player like Virgil for you no for sure Virgil everybody know Virgil everybody know his quality he's uh for me he's the best no one is better than him in this position and uh for me I Le a lot for him from other player like mati Jo Gomez and the other player who don't play in my position as well and uh like you know and like I said to to him always is I I never said to him but in interview I said always I just want to be better than him one day and that's why I work hard to to reach this level one day what's fa to say to that what does Vel say to that huh what does Vel say to that no no no I said I never said to him in interview but uh no he will be proud I think hey um I guess ding by the number of questions you've had about your injury and playing with pain we see it as something unusual for you to do but is is that something that that the squad generally would do you know in terms of they were play because of the situation the club is in all the trophies they're chasing that the the spirit within the squad means that players put themselves through a bit extra to get themselves through games when they're probably not fit no I don't think so I just talk about my situation personally and no everyone will take his time to come back really fit uh to play but uh no no no I was just talking about me but what mean the sort of a the togetherness of the squad means that people are willing to do that teammates yeah yeah for sure for sure for sure yeah I would not be surprised if someone do that because uh everyone want to fight for this club want to fight for fans and uh at the end if we reach something nice we will be happy because we have done a sacrifice and uh yes okay in French then I just wanted to get back to Le you you said what you think about the team already have you been surprised by the progress you know having beaten a team like Real Madrid and if you're surprised what surprised you most well no I'm not surprised at all honestly I'm not surprised far from it um perhaps their opponents underestimated Leo going into their game because you know when you you look at Leo against Real Madrid well Real Madrid were probably sure that they were going to win a lot of people would think that but that isn't what the champions league is like there's a great at atere it's a different atmosphere um the matches give you a different type of energy different type of dynamism and you have to be focused 100% you have to be ready to play the game I think that what they've been doing since the beginning of this season is fantastic and I'm really pleased um for them they're a French team after all but they've been doing that they've been playing well for quite a few years now haven't they
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,EPHK6POEX6c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPHK6POEX6c,well a lot of trer speculation at the moment Mo link with alal yourself link with car Scalia ker linked with Napoli Harvey linked with Brighton and Dortmund what substance is there to any of that when you said yourself linked with I was like which club is going to say now but you mean as a club we are linked with qu Scalia uh what I make of that is that it's January uh and I think I said it after the West Ham uh uh game that uh don't disappoint me uh please come up with all these clubs and all these players that are in the interest uh from us or the ones that don't play a lot for us going to go somewhere else yeah that's what's happening now and uh nine out of 10 times 99 out of 100 times in the end of the window it's been clear that almost all of these stories weren't true so uh what can I commend about it that the rumors keep keep keep going for it but no commments from my side what you can tell us about though is the players that you have available to you so shabos qua how are they and what opportunity is it to give me to the likes of Harvey federo and and Conor Bradley every game is an opportunity for them uh to have a chance to play uh and and this one as well uh Dom trained with uh with uh the under 20 21s yesterday um derell like I said he was a bit bit ill last week I think there was uh as a result of that I had to take him off during the game but I'm expecting him to be available for tomorrow uh so um yes we um we know we can use these players in every single game and also in the one we have on Saturday you know how the relationship between Liverpool and aington uh not that much of course because uh I'm only here for half a year uh but I I do know about the milk effort of probably everybody uh knows this immediately after the game there was a there was a a clip or a video about a player that was so happy that uh that that he was going to play at anfield so these kind of things I know I know people from this area uh also play for that club um there's quite a lot actually that I already know and of course of course I know uh a lot about the team uh which today I'm going to be even know more about uh because we're going to dive into it even more today but um yeah that's all I can say about it m on that um the standards have been so high for Liverpool this season incredibly high so when they slip even very very slightly it's it's kind of sort of very noticeable and we know Manchester United played really well against you know Tottenham too but any reasons inh housee for for maybe the lack of Rhythm and the passing hasn't been as crisp and sharp perhaps um I don't see that many differences compared to some to to many other games we've played the only difference is that we've played these two games after winning 63 from Tottenham and winning 5- nil from West Ham so after those two games uh everybody uh uh said we we know they were good but that they were that good we probably uh uh didn't know even that yet so if you compare to those standards I do agree that the games against United and against the last game against Tottenham were of lower standards compared to those two if you look back at all the other games so even ler City away we were two one up with with 10 10 minutes to play so we we the whole season I said this many times we won a lot of games and almost every game we won maybe the only exception could be but all the other ones we've deserved to win but never buy a big margin it was always very tight and if people ask me what can we improve that is increasing that margin uh because otherwise you always depend on a bit of luck or a bit of being unlucky as well or a certain decision that can be made I you know I mean the the referee decision uh of course and we must make sure that we are not we don't depend on those moments anymore and that's the next step we have to make if we want to if we don't want to depend on luck or bad luck uh because um Crystal Palace away they got a big chance 10 minutes before the end didn't score we beat them with one nil and I know in football it's everywhere the same around the world you're only judged by the results and because of the results people judge you on the performance and it's not many times that if a team has a draw or a loss that that people say they played really really really well the Tottenham it's a long answer this the Tottenham game if the referee would have given the red card we would have kept a clean sheet over there maybe maybe be able to score against 10 men everybody what have said again a difficult away game with a clean sheet they totally controlled and dominated the game uh again a good performance of uh of Liverpool and now uh because we conceded the goal it's all about us being a bit more sloppy and all these kind of things that's that's what this industry is about and uh it's up to me to see is there really so much difference between us playing Leicester City playing ipswitch away playing Crystal Palace away and I think we are still the same team also in terms of performance so this game represents an opportunity for lots of players who've been on The Fringe of things and haven't been able to play as many games as they would have liked certainly and if you look at Harvey Elliot in particular he's had problems with injuries uh which you know have undermined his opportunities to progress but but he's such a talented player that when you get to that stage he can only learn so much in training can't he so he does need games and otherwise he kind of like hit at brick wall I agree with you he's a talented player he's he's been this for us for so long um in in recent weeks he he comes in quite a lot uh and gets his his minutes over there but like it is for him like it is for all the others they are in competition with many other good players as well and uh he was very unlucky that I think it was after two games he got injured was out for a long time and what I've seen till now with almost all of the players that have been out for quite a while that it's in in this league in this Tempo in this intensity in the quality we have but the other team the other teams have as well it is not so easy to come back and be at your best immediately uh I see this not not only with Harvey I see this with like I said with with almost all the other players that been out for five six seven or eight weeks uh so um and that is the balance we have to find by giving them playing time to get back back to the best level but still be able to win every game because like I just said our margins are constantly uh uh small is that right yeah small and if you're 5 n up you can give players that have been out for quite a long time half an hour or a half or even longer but that is not the way we win our won our game still now and uh that's also the reason why if we have one or two times a a bit we are a bit unlucky that we can uh draw a game or lose your game the show team T is that an area you need to look at to give Trent more protection uh might be true if you tell me mostly he's about the stats but uh uh is that by a margin is is we are talking here about uh right side 70% left side 30% or is it right and and left left 32 32 okay so that is more but it's not by uh by a mile so uh could also mean that we attack a lot on our right side that they pick up the ball and then play their Counterattack over that side so um if it's only 12% I don't see anything in in this what we do have to see is how we con seeed our chances how we concede our goals and that's not only about our right side because if they attack on our right side they still have to go to the middle to find the goal and if they go to the middle it's the players who play in the middle and the players from the left side that have to come inside have to defend that that as well so uh I do see a certain pattern in the goal we concede but I don't see the pattern if it's about Trend if that's what you mean not at all uh Trent has had one difficult game for us uh and maybe a few that were okay to good and mainly he had great games when he played for us this season so uh I know there's a lot of focus on him at the moment but um I would also like to highlight the focus on how well he did when he came in the last half hour and how our fans reacted on him that is what pleased me me me me even more uh during that game what what are the different ches of facing a team from the lower divisions who come field so should be experience what what are the challenges yeah um I think every team that plays against us uh it's it's a special occasion uh for every team we face but but especially for a lower uh uh uh League team uh so they will be all up for it they've they've they've lived towards this game for many weeks probably nine out 10 times all players are fit then there's no one suspended so uh uh and the challenge is always uh to bring the best out of ourselves so I think everybody uh uh could understand that um if you fa if you go to a Champions League final uh everyone is is completely hyped up and ready and that is for them today tomorrow it's it's going to feel as if it's the Champions League final so uh we have to be aware of that uh and and nine out of 10 times then the first 25 minutes half hour is is the most difficult part of the game because they will still be very intense and it's up to us to be ready for them uh uh wanting to play the best game of their lives and that is what we have to do as well what's your experience playing teams who you as a player or as a manager shots I mostly played at at a team that were were uh uh were not as good as the one we fa that's not completely true but large parts of my career was true um my experience as a manager I have uh I I don't know um when I was at Fino I always said uh uh that I was unlucky in in in in the draw the draw what we mean and what I mean with that is that almost every time we had a draw we had the most difficult one that we could get in that draw and that means you play the same uh uh team in that play in the same league where other teams maybe sometimes had a we call this an amateur Club does that means that there are no professionals that's in in Holland that that can be sometimes a situation so I don't remember playing against uh a very low League uh low League uh Club in my man uh manager career in Holland to be fair but I I was only a manager there for three or four years so there something to do with as well hi um I am kind of interested in the P you notic in conceding but I dare say you're probably not going to tell me so my question's more about rest and Rhythm um the players got some time off between the Manchester United and the West H game after I think it was six games in 19 days or something like that now I've heard you talk before about how used to playing every 3 days this team are and maybe that suits them a little better so I wondered how complicated have you found it getting that balance between the rest and the Rhythm when uh in your first season here in England with the extended champions league and with two domestic Cup competitions um it's not difficult uh uh because I think if you are in in in a league like this and you play so many games uh uh that it's it's it's one of the most important thing you can do is give players some rest once in a while when it's possible uh then you always uh uh Wonder for yourself uh if they've been indeed a few days off which has happened many more times this season where afterwards we did had the results you always wonder you always try to look back and reflect on okay what have we done could we've done better um but um in both games we've we we had a lot of intensity it was necessary because both games were was intense especially against Tottenham if you look at the at the output uh physical output it was one of our best games this season that's not to say if we played the best with the ball but physical output so that tells you then maybe that for them being rested that at least they are completely ready to compete so you cannot see what some people try to uh say now that we might be tired or those kind of things no not at all and we are we are we are even having a step up but what what probably was not seen a lot is that uh compared to the game two weeks ago we've changed five positions and a few of them didn't had a lot of playing time uh in the last six or seven weeks and uh that's what I just also said if a player is out for six or seven weeks in this league and has to train for himself and then comes back in this intensity it's sometimes you have have to find your Rhythm uh in the first 10 15 or 20 minutes and I think that's exactly what you saw against Tottenham that's why that's probably stayed in the head for many people a long time but if I look the game back and I look at the last 70 minutes I see that we were able just as many times as two weeks ago arriving in and around the final third uh uh uh uh of Tottenham just as many times two weeks ago now there was a difference in the final F we were not uh creating as much chances uh from getting into those positions as we did two weeks ago but that is that is a normal situation in the season that's that's the most difficult part of of of the pitch the final thir uh and um sometimes these attackers create chance after chance and sometimes it's a bit harder so I don't see anything into this it's obviously being a tough start for him here with Fitness and Ki team what do you want to see from him in the second half of the season is tomorrow maybe a chance for him to to get some of that with matchness like I said every game is a chance for every player uh to get some playing time uh it's not only for him being difficult because uh all of things you just said I'm not going to say all these things again in terms of mat Fitness it's also that he has to compete with the likes of Cody kako Lis Diaz Joo jot Darwin Nunes and mo Salalah and um everybody here knows the numbers Mo Salah brings in there there's not many times a reason to take him out uh during a game or before a game also because he's so fit uh I said many times before he was the fittest player that came in in preseason and he does everything every single day to keep this met Fitness and he wants to play every game and he and he shows up every single game so it's not only about Federico when we are talking about him being Limited in his playing time it's also about the others but but in terms of federo definitely has to do with with the way he came in uh the uh I don't know the English words uh so the rest were already training a lot and and and we had to bring him up in terms of M fishness so it's a combination of reasons why he didn't play that much yet but uh let's wait and see in the upcoming weeks and months if he can if he's able to help us because the second half this even is even more important than the first half wanted to ask about um R and Goomer and train I onlyi whether this might be an opportunity I know they've been training with you of late is this going to be a chance for them to get some minutes or will they be around the squad tomorrow uh like I said uh I didn't say it yet but uh we still have to train yesterday we we couldn't because uh our flight uh uh going back to London arrived quite late uh here so we gave them uh as a result of the the day off so we have to wait and see how everybody uh is recovered uh today and then we have to make a decision which players we're going to bring to the game but Trey has been in the squad many times already I think Rio only once Southampton away I think uh but these players are doing really well when they train with us doing really well when they play with the under 21s so as long as they keep doing that their chances of getting their moment in the first team will increase of course any more [Music] no thank you [Music] [Music]
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,uh5_wfrJGRY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh5_wfrJGRY,you were in W sorry you were in W no I was I was on a road to day off and I'm working that much at the moment I was struggling to fit in switching days you see so it's just like well you may as well just take that one and then get back in s anyway enough about me aror obviously it's a two-legged semi-final strange situation where each game is a month apart but I just wonder what you're expecting this time around because it's only a few weeks since that 63 away at Spurs as well yeah um I think what we expect before we go into the game uh that two teams have such a clear identity and playing style that that is I think what most people expect to see uh tomorrow again as well so they have their identity we have our own identity and both teams trying to for for that identity towards the other and um large parts of of the away away game two weeks ago we could uh we could show our identity but there were definitely also Parts in the game where uh they showed how good of a team they are uh scoring free goals against us is um is also an accomplishment I know we've scored six in that game as well but scoring three against us is what not many teams have done till now how ready are Connor Bradley and Diego goata to start will tell her come back in as well and I'm just wondering how much you even need to retain the squad ahead of this game I think if you look at all the fixtures we've had this season there are so many things going into a lineup uh shortterm long-term qualities of the opponent where are my players uh so it's going to be always a decision made about in our opinion the best lineup for um for for tomorrow and uh in some situations for sthampton away or other games in my opinion the best lineer was the ones that didn't start a lot uh and that see what that is tomorrow um for the game we play uh we play against Tottenham understand as well no further developments regarding contracts regarding further bids for your players but just on Trend obviously the attention ahead of the United game was about that bid from Real Madrid after the game it was his his performance um how is he being under that that scrutiny and how sure are you that he remains unaffected by that scrutiny as well I think we were all disappointed not only Trent we were all disappointed by the way we played um and no first of all about the results and uh parts of the game we could be quite satisfied with other parts of our game we weren't completely happy with so uh that was not only Trend there were more things uh in the game that we could have done better Trent uh didn't play his best game I said it already but that's not for the first first time in his life I think he didn't play the best game of his career he's played so so so many games well for this club now it wasn't his best like for some others it wasn't the best game for some others as well and we just pick it up start train today again uh because these players know if you play 50 60 games in the season that uh once in a while you don't play you don't have your best performance maybe we should highlight more how good it is for that these players are able to play every three days such a good game and apart from the game maybe not being the best it was again an eventful game from Liverpool so all the games we've played in the last 6 months and maybe even longer when Yan was here I think um I got many text messages from people saying what a game again so unbelievable what happened last 10 minutes both teams playing fully for a win and that is also part of our job I think to um to make it a eventful game and that is what we are trying to do every game mostly uh with a result of winning now it wasn't enough to win it but it was definitely an interesting game for everyone to watch you do with the headlines around those three players plus you've got two Cup competitions now this week there are things like social media posts being dissected and being you know does this mean something how are you handling that level of debate with your players uh I'm not leveling that debate with my players I talk to my players so if there's anything that worries them then they share this with me but the other and that has not happened till now so what uh what I do with the players is showing them what we could have done better against United what we've done well against United because I think especially in the first half we created some very good chances out of a very good style of play uh and the mentality we showed after being one nil down was also something every fan likes to see and and me as a manager likes to see as well well so that is where we are focusing up on and I'm not focused on social media posts or what has been s about us because if you do that as a Liverpool manager you have no life because this is one of the biggest clubs in the world and every second of the day people talk about us so uh it already takes a lot of my time to prepare the next game and to look back at the game we just played if I have to do this as well then um I need just as him a few days off once in a while as well with with the game against aington coming up after this first leg semi-final as well and you're saying there you're looking at the players for tomorrow that maybe aren't getting those minutes is this a chance for those players that aren't getting those minutes to get two games in a row do you see the FA Cup as another opportunity for them uh maybe um I didn't use my words in the proper way I didn't say that for tomorrow the players will play that haven't played much I said there are many considerations you you make before you make a lineup one of them is the thing you just said but there are many other things going into a lineup as well so we might play a few players that haven't played all the games and we might play a few players that have played uh all the games and we and so I can tell you now what it would be it's the first time we train again after after uh Sunday so yesterday of course the players were not off but they did recovery so let's see how they um came out of the game and um then we will make the line up for for tomorrow you're spoking about how well players have dealt with or playing every three three games three days sorry with that in mind will it benefit Trent to have a game coming so soon to to get a bad fance out of his system I think it would benefit every player uh uh that we uh had a disappointment disappointed result uh we would have loved to win that game um so then every player wants to play uh two days later again uh but every player that was not on the pitch would love to play tomorrow as well so that's the good thing they all want to play almost all of them are fit that is quite special in this part of the Season as well and I would highlight more on the fact that these players show up every three days because they did show up also against United United if I uh if I'm correct think the manager said was one of their best games they've played till now now uh if that means that if they play so well we can still come up with a 2 two and having more chances than them then we're not in such a best place as maybe all the people will tell us we are uh so we just analyze it um as we always do and prepare ourselves for the next one can I ask you about Cody gpo's contribution as well scored again the weekend 12 for the season 10 in the last 16 I mean and this this competition he's he's done really well in this competition um just his contribution almost seems to go under the radar cuz he's playing with the liks of Mo and your people like that just what what has he has he he brought to the side for you a lot uh but I think I've uh said already a few times that I can completely understand how much how much Focus there is on most performance because that is remarkable if a player has so many goals and so many assists but if you combine the goals of Lucho and uh and Cody when they play as a left Winger they come quite close to the numbers has it's in Mo's advantage that because of federo is not always available he's playing from the first to the last minute but I think our left Winger position brings comes quite close to the uh numbers mooh has so that probably tells you then as well that is a part of this success is definitely the quality of the players but a part of it is also the playing style we have so uh I just mentioned that again the game against United was a game that everybody loved to watch because we play such an attacking style of football and uh what comes with an attacking style of football is scoring a lot of goals and that's what we do at the moment AR did you expect to have Dominic Back available uh yesterday wasn't in yet so um if he's in today I I I I would doubt if he's available to start uh the game but hopefully he's in today um but yesterday he wasn't with the window being open do when you look at the depth you've got do you think you there's enough there to to last the pace this season or do you think anything needs to be added to the squad in this window would be a bit weird if I if I said during the summer break that uh we we are very happy with the team that I would tell you something completely different now but you always look at the market this club has always looked at the market I think we did this with the with the goalkeeper we don't even have at the moment if there is a chance in the market this this club always uh tries to bring that chance in but um the team is in a good Place unfortunately Joe Gomez is injured that means we go from three from four center backs back to two to three sorry but uh he will be back in a few weeks so very happy with the team uh and I think they deserved uh that trust from the club and from me uh if you look at the performances they've brought in the last half of half season hi um only asked conceded less goals in the league than Liverpool this season but of the 19 we have conceded 11 of those have come in the last six games now obviously there's been some defensive injuries and the red card in that time but you always talk about defending with all 11 players so do you think there's been anything systemically that's changed or maybe even opponents have started playing you differently which has caused some of these more goals to come in uh lot of questions so I can answer a lot of things but uh I've said in the beginning of the season when we've ConEd one or two chances sometimes we were a bit lucky or was the quality from from the goalkeeper that that we didn't concede I don't think we concede many more chances than we did uh when we kept the clean sheets we had a against clean seat against West Ham when they hit the bar and the post so that is a bit of football as well it's also about the teams you face if you go away to Newcastle I think that's a difficult away game for everyone um so there we ConEd it free we conceded two against Fulham with the red card included of course and um conceding goals against United which is a very good team in the league I know everybody is looking at the league table but that is so far off from the quality they have that um that that that that is part of a season as well so during a season sometimes the other teams has three or four chances and they don't score and sometimes out of two chances they do score their goals that has happened quite a lot recently um what I still see also when we concede the second goal against United I think we had more bodies in our 18 Yard Box than them and uh Robo tried to do everything made a sliding sliding tackle but the ball went through his legs and went in and it went through the legs of IBU so as long as we bring more bodies inside the Box than the other team then um still you don't like to see you conceding a goal but I still I see the same work rate we had as in the beginning of the season and that is what necessary and then it's also sometimes about the quality you face which is something happened against United and and Newcastle because they have attackers that don't only score against us also to against other teams how much you think Alex M has benefited from that great he I'm sure he want to L but he has played a lot of football from last Season Pro to the cop of America so you think has rejuvenated him a little bit no because he played outstanding before so the when I think about Maka I think I cannot come up with a poor performance from him he's so he's so concern consistent in his performances uh of course he's not like Mo or Cody or Lucho scoring 15 goals and 12 assists but he's so involved in every game we play uh so important for us defensively as well uh bringing the ball towards these players so for me he didn't find better performances afterwards but I think every player benefits for the long term to have sometimes a few days or a few a period of as well so I was happy happy that I could give this to him but I don't think his performances are better now than before he got the break I hopefully because of this break it will give him even more consistent performances in February March and April as well going back to Trent how was he doing mentally I know you said after Sunday that it's not a distraction speculation but it was a difficult performance obviously there's a lot of speculation a lot of scrutiny how how's he doing after that have you spoken to him individually yeah but I spoken to him uh to other players individually as well which you do almost after every other game and uh I spoke to him before the game and then I already said to everyone maybe you are not there things I talk to him about I do not share over here but it's normal that you talk to players uh uh always and uh in this situation it wasn't his best game so there were things I had to show on which he has to improve um and um and that's what you always do a after every game sometimes you show them how well they did mostly when it comes to work rate so they don't have to say they they're brilliant 80 yard pass because that they know uh and sometimes you have to show them what they can improve but I don't only did this with TR uh we were just talking about Maka I think if you look at the second call we concede in the cutback Ross if he Sprints a bit harder he could prevent the cut back the the the shot from Theo as well so there are always things you can improve but uh in general they've worked really hard gave everything together results and unfortunately um we were unable to get the best result but we still got a result last couple of years maybe two the last three years the team has been in all Four competitions quite late on and last year there was a sort of seemed bit of a step too far at the end I mean is there any you spoke to the players any lessons that can be R from as any con for about all the demands or is it just something that with the experience you've had that'll help it's it's very difficult for me to compare last season with this season the only thing I do know is that uh what what gives me the most confidence to look forward to the upcoming weeks and months is that till now we haven't stolen one point all the points we got were fully deserved and I think even uh in some moments we deserve more than we got in the in when we Dro points so uh that is I think the best forecast you can have for for the second half of the season and I don't know how that was last season if if if all the results were as expected or fully deserved or there were a few lucky moments as well I don't know um but what I do know is that this season all the points we've got and all the results we've got were deserved in my opinion and and all the players are fit at the moment but yeah again if we drop points uh when we have when teams have injuries people say yeah that's because you have injuries if we drop points if Mo misses the penalty against uh uh uh Madrid he's distracted by his contract situation if Contra if Trent has a not his best performance he's distracted by the contract situations if they play really well nobody tells me yeah that's because they have a contract situation so we always try to find arguments but nine out of 10 times the best argument is uh the quality of the teams you face or the game plan the other team has and um United had a very good game plan no buildup at at at least not from the start just bring the ball long just don't give us the chance to press them High and um and go to a low block uh which makes it always difficult for every team to create chances uh which we did quite a lot actually but um I think it's more about the game plan when we drop points then it is about too many games players being distracted having injuries all these kind of things it's nine out of 10 times because the team you face have you decided what you going to do with then who's going to play and goal we come back in or is there something to decide tomorrow I think I've decided the whole lineup already but um in many ways uh people have tried to uh get to know what the lineup is but I know uh the league cups tended to be gev's competition he's obious get go one twice yeah I know but uh I said many times that there are many things going into a lineup uh and that's the same for tomorrow again so uh you will find out tomorrow what arguments there are and if they've asked me before the game I'm and after the game I'm always more than happy to answer those questions but first of all I think the players should know how we're going to play and if all of them are available that is also something uh we have to find out thank you thanks
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,CTevkZTQSF8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTevkZTQSF8,I know it's probably something similar to what we spoke about after the Leicester game but a seven-point lead at the top do you feel that brings a little bit more pressure and the expectations change at this stage of the Season we're almost at a halfway stage no you're sitting in front of the Liverpool manager so there's always pressure at this club if we are 1 2 3 four five in the table if you work at a big club like Liverpool there's always the pressure and I think last season halfway through the season they uh were they also number one I think they were last season yes yeah so uh it's not so strange for a club like us to be on top of the league but it is we know how many good teams there are in this league uh and uh they want to they they are able to to win almost every game as well so um there's no extra pressure there's always pressure if you work at a club like Liverpool your form away from home is is fantastic it's West Ham on on Sunday um how do you prepare any differently is just here we go again no I I think our away form has been good but it it maybe has a bit to do with the teams you face in the first half of the season so uh um I think mainly we fac the teams the top half of the table at home and um and the other ones uh we faced away so that might have something to do with it but it's um yeah uh uh we are a strong team away from from home and at home as well um so yeah I don't see any reason why we are stronger there than here um something we can best judge in the end of the season if we played every team home and away to see what uh what fits us best but I think we are a difficult team to beat uh away from home as in our home games you'll be aware that Dominic to is suspended having picked up a yellow card against against Leicester um but this is a period where You' probably got to use use and utilize the squad more anyway given the amount of matches yeah that's what you saw today as well because I think Dominic SOS was outstanding against Tottenham mport um and the idea and the plan was that he should be outstanding against West Ham but he's not available so someone else should be outstanding against West Ham loose tomorrow is seven years since Vil sign for the CL I know you've not been there for most of that time but as a feather Dutchman I just wondered how far off his best level do you think he is now or is this the best level we've seen on thepool shirt from yeah that is difficult for me to judge because like you said I I wasn't here uh when feril was close to winning the ball onor for example and he's been uh I think a tremendous player such a such a great player for Liverpool for so many years unfortunately for him he was out with an injury for almost the whole of the Season that didn't help this football club at all so that probably tells you how big of an impact he has had here at this club um I can only tell you what my experiences are with him and he's been not only from what you see because you see him during the game and he's outstanding during the game but he has such a big impact in training session as well he's he's the focal leader of this team every time we start an exercise he's every time on top of his teammates and he leads by example so for me he's been outstanding till now and we can only hope he can continue showing this during the games and in in the training sessions um as long as he's with us and H I just ask this question because it's obviously your last home appearance before the first of January when with the contract three uh things could uh can happen from that date are you expecting anything momentous or significant to change from that or on that if we would then probably it's not the moment for me to tell you now but uh in general I don't talk about contract situations here and uh it would be a surprise if I was the one to announce that one of them have extended so I think that's in a diff in a different moment but just yeah keep asking because that's your job but you're probably not going to get an answer from me um but it's clear that um from the 1 of January maybe for you guys things change a lot but they are in constant talks with the club and um let's wait and see what what happens as long as they keep performing like this uh the manager or the head coach I have to say is happy with them you mentioned injuries and suspensions it looks like West Ham might be without all three Central Midfield as he started against Southampton Rodriguez so spended Carlos went off injured you fac mohamd kudas lot when he was the ax do you think is's a chance he may line up in Center Midfield and how good a player you think he can play I think he's a good player uh that's for sure everybody sees this he can play multiple positions I think he played here for Ajax against Liverpool as a nine as well so um he's he's a big threat for them they have many players I think they've signed also many players during the during the summer so even if free midfielders are out I don't think they have to play under 21 players they are still able to play players they brought in for many many many millions so um yeah that's the Premier League they all have not only us or Chelsea uh it's for a lot of clubs have have so many good players uh we although were the one when I didn't play my starters we used our 21 players that is uh part of our identity and that's what makes this club special I think as well last couple will and Paul um I think the last thing for sure uh we still managing his he's been out for quite a long time and he couldn't train that much so sometimes if a player has an injury he can do a lot but he couldn't do a lot for quite a long time and um yeah since this league is so intense it's not so easy if you're almost two months out to to come in and and play from the start again you need to have some minutes to build this up and he is in competition with some other special players as well who are at this moment also on top of their game and um he's gradually building it up and um I think he comes close to start a game but like I said he has competition in this position as well last one Paul bradle will be back for Manchester United they will not be back for West Ham United uh but then there's a week in between so um let's see how close they are then it's difficult for me to tell you at this moment because they don't train with the group yet but hopefully in the upcoming days they they come closer to that situation and then again IU has been out then for five six weeks maybe gor even longer I don't know no just as long I think same amount uh and also for them they're in competition with players that are completely fit and are doing really well so um I have to make the right judgment uh the moment they back with the team thank you ad
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,rpOfpE4hSXU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rpOfpE4hSXU,and it's been a a very happy Christmas seven points clear at the top how' you feel it's it's it's first of all it's important to win a game and uh I think we should win at home against D but I had the same feeling against Fulham and nothing home for us so you always have to do a lot especially in premier league to win a game and that was also today because we went one nil down but yeah it's it the league table is um is something of course we are aware of but we also understand how many games there are still to play you you've scored a lot of goals in the second half of games this season how crucial was that breakthrough just before halim I think that was crucial today uh I was happy with the first half performance I was happy with the start there was only one minute I wasn't happy with and that was the minute we conceded a goal but that was I think the only thing we didn't do well during the first half we created from the start our chances we threatened them a lot brought a lot of balls into the box where we arrived with many players as our Robo many times in front of goal so I could not have asked for that much more uh but I think it was crucial to score the 1-1 just before halftime because that that that lifted us up and that you could see that immediately in the second half where we just kept on going what we did and it's not only helpful for us but I think it also was uh it works the opposite way for Lester they felt like okay now it's going to be tough most Sal continues to deliver he might have a slightly quieter game today but he still produces the goods when it really matters yeah no great goal uh again uh similar to the first one from Cody I think both both goals were quite similar and um I think it was just before we scored the one-1 that Mo had uh had a similar shot that hit the bar uh and he had just before that he had a shot with his right that just went over the bar so like I said we arrived there many times and if if these players like Cody like Lucho like Joo like Darwin like if they arrive often enough in promising positions they will deliver James coule figures now for C this season you must be delighted with the form he's in and also you played in promly off the lap where previously play a lot more what you think makes most effective out why I think the main difference maybe is that uh the setup from the front three was a bit different uh uh than um than the setup now I I think from we expect a bit more from our Wingers to keep it wide uh to try to get them in one V one situations and um Cody has done this really well Lucho has done this really well when he played from the left but Lucho is in our opinion also capable of playing as a nine he's done that really well against Spurs uh and and yeah like we like I said it's uh against Spurs it was maybe mainly Lucho and and Cody that were do sorry and mo that were dominant now it was Cody again together with Mo so it's just nice to have so many options uh in uh in every position actually but also uh in the in the front fre any more for the rest time ah I think um if if if you in this game for a long time like these players are I am as well that then you know 20 games before the end you don't you don't look at it way you know so many challenges are still ahead of you I think was two months ago that we were one point behind City and look what has happened there in terms of injuries and then you have a bit of bad luck and you had a suspension and this can happen to any team and and and um so it's far too early to already be celebrating but it is of course nice for us to be the team who we are so we know we are able to do this but uh you've been at all these games like me and I don't think there was any easy win for us during all these games you could could it could have been an easy win against uh against toam but then we conceded to and was 53 and I was still like okay I was quite happy with have scoring a six goal so uh that tells you how difficult it is to win if all your players are available let alone if somewhere during the season uh you pick up some injuries or suspensions and um that's why why we just have to take it one game a Time
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,rZmgJBvwyrg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZmgJBvwyrg,um Leicester on boxing night um we know under the new manager they've had some good results and some bad ones but they're capable at the best and at this time of the year quite often there are shock results teams from the bottom the teams from the top what do you expect and what do you think I think the positive is that teams that are positioned in the Lower Side of The League table they mostly lose games but since rud is there they also won a few so that shows you that he's done really well especially when he came in now he had I think two diff two tough results in a row so um yeah these teams all of them it's special for them to go to anfield and they know if they go to anfield they have to be at their best so they will never underestimate us and hopefully maybe that's the good thing about these 15 minutes we saw today that we understand we cannot underestimate one minute in the Premier League because um then we're not as good as we might think we are if we are on top of our game you came up against story in Holland when your final team beat his PSV team for the title tell us a bit more about about that rivalry you had and also your relationship with him I was expecting you to tell the people over here that I lost once and draw once but you made it positive saying that we won the league title uh uh which was true but um Cody kako was in in his team so I'm happy that he's in my team now when we phasor it uh because Cody uh I think in both games he scored uh root is a is a very uh nice uh person first of all um I met him once or twice and I think he did really well when he was at PSV because PSV for the last one and a half year uh they've been on top of the league table but if you look at the second half of roots season I think they didn't even lose anymore at all so uh it wasn't a surprise that after we left and they bought so many players because PSV started buying a few more players than they did when he was working there because when he was there Cody kako and M Waker were sold um but he still showed that he could compete for the title and um nice person good manager did well at United as well but um looking forward to see him especially if we win a quick turn around or Bradley being back no
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,ARcxG8W1ZHM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARcxG8W1ZHM,particularly canate Simas and Bradley how are they are they ready yet or is it more the weekend or a bit longer uh Costas is coming close um she going to train with us today maybe for the first time so let's see uh how that works out IO and uh and Connor are still not training with us uh you yourself have got to serve a touchline band for this game against Southampton how do you feel about having to serve that and how will it impact you throughout the game um not as much as I thought I it should impact me because if you are suspended in uh in Holland then you're not allowed to be in and around the dressing room uh you you can not do the media as well so uh this is a lighter version of of uh of suspension uh I would say that I'm used to but I've never been used to being suspended so it's the first time I am um yeah uh so um I think I'm still able to do the things I want to do uh the moment you have the less impact you have on your team is is during the 45 minutes and the most impact you can have is at halftime before or before the game uh and those are the things I can do but in ideal situation I would have just been on the sideline but um I got a yellow which I probably deserved again as well and um yeah this happens do you think you deserved all of them are you a little bit surprised to be in no no one of the one of the three I didn't deserve but I I told what I said back then which was for Tony he okay that's where we don't use that much over here um but that was meant to one of my players so that one was a misunderstanding but the one I got against Chelsea was absolutely deserved this game I could have I could have got five maybe so um to to come out with one was was maybe even a I have to thank the the referee for that but what do you expect from Southampton given obviously they've changed their manager or they're about to change the manager but they have taken Russell Martin out to that yeah yeah which is uh which is in my opinion A pity and uh maybe it's a good moment when we talk about uh uh referee decisions and how to react on that and and the manager being sacked I feel really really sorry for Gary O'Neal uh he's done so well in my opinion if you look at how his team is playing and he was so so so unlucky in multiple occasions especially against West Ham in my opinion so uh these things happen and and Russell Martin has done so well last season at Southampton plays this season again a good football we've experienced this when we uh had such a tough day over there we only beat them 3-2 so you always feel sorry if managers uh don't get the chance to to continue um and especially in these two situation because for me they are uh uh managers that uh had a good idea of how they wanted to play with the team and uh unfortunately uh um they they weren't able to get enough points uh and uh then manages get sacked do do you wonder what to expect whether they Sorry that was your question I didn't answer it at all uh we jack I have um it's difficult because uh I saw them uh during the weekend starting with four at the back which they changed after 15 minutes going to five at the back and the one that takes over uh normally plays with four at the back so uh yeah uh what can you expect what would you expect four or five I'm going four to be fair throw little up in the air in the minute I think the players maybe uh uh feel more comfortable with five from what I saw during the weekend but yeah it's also a moment for the manager to have his impact and may if he truly believes four is the best then he and and depends maybe also how long time is he going to get is he only for there for one game or is he there for longer uh will he play with his normal starters if he only has one chance or a few chances to lead the team will he then do what's uh uh was best for the Premier League or for him as a chance to uh maybe reach the semi-final of The League Cup so it's difficult what we can expect um in terms of formation in terms of uh Personnel but what we do know is that we have to play in away game against Southampton against 11 players thank you J morning I just want to check right now where you are as a side is this where you anticipated to be in in a quarterfinal still fighting on all fronts when when you came into this job to a certain extent yes because I think that is normal for Liverpool to be fighting for every Trophy and to be uh uh uh for a long time in every cup uh to go all all the way uh this happened last season when we uh not we but when this club won this uh competition so I'm not surprised that with the quality we have we are competing uh at this moment uh for these three uh trophies and the fourth one is starting in January but it's uh it is a challenge because we have a lot of competition great competition in other teams here as well and also in the League Cup if you look at the other teams that are still in uh it's um it's for none of the teams that are in is going to be an easy uh an easy road to the final and doo J has returned to the squad is this a good time for him with all these games and this particular match coming up to get more match Fitness uh that is for me the positive uh positive thing also about the League Cup because like you've seen I think till now we haven't played uh with many starters yet so it's mostly been a game where the ones that haven't played that much started the game and that's that's really important so for the likes of vat uh Ando for example he hasn't played that much but but but fortunately for us he plays for his national team and the few times he can play in the League Cup helps him to keep his rhythm as well so um Joo would have been definitely one that was ideal for him to play but after the game he he he he wasn't completely fit so he didn't train with us yesterday so let's see if he can train with us today um so don't expect him to start hopefully he can make some minutes but I don't expect him to start tomorrow thank you hi Anna it's been notable in all the games that Liverpool haven't been winning towards the end that you've been willing with your tactics and your substitutions to maybe sacrifice a defeat in the pursuit of a win uh even in situations where maybe a draw would be creditable like away at Arsenal or down to 10 men for 70 minutes for example has this always been your philosophy or have you maybe been influenced by the group who've been so good at winning games later on it is a combination of both it's always been my philosophy uh since I've been the manager uh to try to win the game in the end um uh so um but it's definitely also that our players have this same mentality long long long before I came here so uh it's probably also the mentality of the club is the mentality of the players maybe that's also one of the reasons why they brought me in because it's also my mentality to uh to try to win every game um even if we in a situation like you said where um where you can accept a draw as well but um it's it's it's the mentality we have together and that's why we uh we are at this moment of time happy with each other I know you said Joo might not be fit enough to start but how's feder Rico doing is this a game where he could potentially start him he still needs to be managed a bit carefully it's definitely a moment where you can get minutes and the amount of minutes is uh is is is a question mark you you cannot expect from him to play 90 I think uh especially on this level uh where the intensity is so high um because he's been out for five or six months now but he will uh if he uh uh has a good training session he will make minutes but it's going to be a game where not all the all our starters will start uh so we have to manage minutes uh if if if the the the few if we want to use a few start is not for 90 minutes so we have to balance I can only make five substitutions if you know what I mean so uh the ones that make minutes and uh and go off maybe at halim uh can be more than five because you can only make five substitutions so um so he will make minutes uh federo tomorrow if he starts or comes in or plays the second half that's something we have to uh we have to make a decision about uh during this day and talk going to m the boots having Allison back for the past couple of games but this competition in the past has been massive for K and K can we expect him to come back in tomorrow yes can and you've spoken a lot about in the past about his quality but just in terms of his character and his temperament as a number two it's one of the most difficult jobs in in football really but can you just tell us a little bit about about him and and how he's dealt with sort of dropping back out of the team yes I agree with you is one of the most difficult jobs in football if the first goalkeeper is always is available uh because then you work for the whole season and you hardly ever have the chance to play because you normally don't come in 10 minutes or 15 minutes before the end he's uh unfortunately for us uh but good for him uh he've already made quite a lot of minutes so I think if you make a list of players of the amount of minutes there will be players that have far less playing time than him so uh uh I think he he can look back at the first half season as for himself as a positive first half of the season uh we as a club of course hope that all players are available in the second half of the season so he will not make the amount of minutes as he did in the first half but we are really fortunate to have such a great second uh goalkeeper that if we need him he's able to do as well as he did um could you talk a little bit about your your back room staff because they'll be maybe a bit lower in the spotlight tomorrow um would be being suspended um you relate how long you've sort of sorry how how much sort of Delegation you give to them how important they are to you your longstanding relationships with cka yeah yeah cka I work with for a long time so we knew we know each other in and out especially uh football wise uh one of the reasons why we work together because we we we have so much in common if it if it's about the playing style or a game model or or or the or the changes we make uh during the game and John H is now here with me for the first half season and uh um I couldn't have wished for more so um very yeah if I say talented I I I I I I I I don't not even rate him high enough because he's more than that already he's been a head coach himself but he's still young but uh uh uh grew into our staff from the start in a in a in a very good manner uh so the same idea about football that's also why why I chose him to come to us as well but the way he's with the boys just like C is very positive we do almost all the things we do we do together uh like in every other staff I think it's like this but that's definitely the way it is over here as well they get a lot of uh time to work with the players in individual way but also lead part of sessions um have the same idea about football as I do so yes I will be involved tomorrow but if I wouldn't be that wouldn't would not be a problem at all for the players they would not notice anything different than I think and then we're talking about the technical staff but I think we've all seen uh how much of a compliment our performance STA and medical staff should have if you look at how players come back like Ellis and like J now two days ago but also that we can we be with 10 and our opponent can say it felt like they had 11 that probably tells you a lot about our performance staff and about the players but I have given them enough compliments so let's stay with the performance staff and uh and the medical staff and my back room staff uh as for now just one on the suspension do you think you need to change anything in the way that you you behaving on the touch L is it just un just unusual have you thought about that at all uh no you always reflect but uh I think in General I'm calm but if if if if I don't know if it's smart to say this but if if so there's there's also a limit for me let's put it that way and uh and then I can get emotional uh and that unfortunately that limit is uh is earlier reached by referee decision than the decision my players make uh because they make more good decisions than the referees do in my opinion for my team no uh the Chelsea game was emotional we we we should have had a second penalty but the F changed it this game I think there were a lot of controversial uh decisions being made uh and if you then down to 10 uh that that that comes even that that works out even harder or I should I say this so um yeah like I said uh Chelsea game in this game was emotional and uh maybe I I should stay just underneath instead of going uh above uh yeah it is what it is I think I have three options to go now again don't I I go is it again free before I start funny if on that topic on I just wanted to say cuz obviously we're very used to what Jurgen Klo is like on the touch line you are not like Jurgen klopp on the touch L but does this show you've still got that what we say fire in the valy you still have that passion yeah I don't always think you have to show it to uh to have that fire I think it's clear that if you work uh in a club like this or around the world in the at a top club you do have this fire inside you of that you want to win every game and you try to influence as much as you as you can and um the mistake I make uh I've made a two times already here and one or two times in Holland that sometimes you think that uh creating an atmosphere that the whole world is against you can lead to some positive decisions in the end of the game but uh um here till now in as well as in the Chelsea game as in this game for the whole 90 minute it stayed the same so it didn't change it wasn't like after I was trying to influence a bit that the refe then all of a sudden gave us one of two uh uh free kicks no he just kept for the whole game the same so um I know that it doesn't work but yeah sometimes you feel can I influenced that a bit but it didn't help at all last one if Sim isn't fit tomorrow we only have four Defenders with Andy Robson suspenders are players like Amaro James Norris even would they be Avail ready to to step up and play and what if you made the young players development Jo time that's very positive uh you talk about these two now but I think we have a few others that have made a a good impact in our training sessions till now we've we've also used them like Trey has has been used already in the league cup I'm aware of the fact that we have only four Defenders available and probably the ones that have started a lot of uh times will not play uh 90 minutes for sure and maybe not even at all so uh it's going to be either Academy players that are going to play uh get playing time or it's going to be uh players that nobody would expect uh to see in the last line that are going to play in the last line tomorrow
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,kjVwr38ULPo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjVwr38ULPo,uh hi Ryan um you're top of the Champions League at the moment um is it an incentive to finish top of the group and and I mean whilst you obviously want the top eight finish first of all what would finishing top of that group mean um yeah of course uh you want to win every game so for us our aim is to win win every group uh group game and then and then we'll see further but if you win every game that means a means a lot to us Lo Ryan you you played every minute of every premier league and Champions League game before you came off at Newcastle two questions me one is how you know physically are you feeling the strain of all that workload or you okay and also secondly how much are you just enjoying being such an integral part of this team after obviously your first season at Liverpool you were kind of in and out of the team um yeah your first question I I feel good I feel fit um I think uh when you play a lot of minutes you get you get fitter and fitter and and for me that's the thing and um the second question was because it was was live just in terms of how much you're enjoying being part of this successful team and being so integral to it after what must have been a frustrating first season where it felt like you were in and out of the team you had some injury issues uh for me the first season was not that frustrating um my aim was to play a lot a lot more minutes than I had before and and I did um and and now yeah I'm just happy to play uh 90 minutes again and be uh every game on the pitch and and that I can show myself so I'm really happy that I can be part of this team so Ryan it was a surprise at the start of the season when you started in the number six role but you've excelled in it you still think though you're you're learning and getting better in the new kind of position for yourself um yeah of course uh I think uh everyone can still can um Can how do you say itust improve improve so as I um yeah it goes really well but um maybe I can do a bit more also in defending but um um I'm really happy with the performance I now have so I have to keep going yes hi ran did you hear after the Madrid game u a lot of people comparing you to Tony Cruz just don't know how you felt about that must have been a big compliment here oh yeah it's nice to hear that of course because Tony CR is a legend of the game he did a lot of good things so it's nice to and to beat leus and and Madrid I mean did you feel like Liverpool are almost becoming the team in this Champions League you must take Confidence from Big victories like um yeah it's nice it's nice to beat them because they are really good good teams and um before us we do G we look game by game and then we see F hi Ryan um think we asked you this at the start of the season when you just moving into that number six role but is there any players aside from around the world that you sort of model yourself on in that role um no not not really to be honest um uh yeah I just want to be myself so just going back to what you were saying earlier um about playing all the time it's really refreshing because at the moment you lots of players are complaining about playing too much and it's clearly something that you're absolutely loving do you think there'll come a point where you might want to break or you just want to play every single game yeah for now it's nice to play play every single game but yeah maybe maybe in the future know when you play a lot of games um um yeah now I think we played 20 games with the champions league and in the competition and if you reach the the the 70 or 60 or 70 that that's really crazy but for now it's okay that's fish Liverpool ranks you have four Latin American players what have you learned from these Latin American players in this time that you've been in the team um just the the willingness to give everything they they always they give everything if you see um um the power what they give and um um the 100% always being on um I think that's the most part what I what I learned from them any more no finish last one at the back mallister is out for tomorrow how important is his absence for the way Liverpool want to play um you know Maka is a really good player and U and we will miss him because uh he's uh he's a top player really good quality um but you have also other midfielders that um that are really good so um and I think and I think we they will show tomorrow also so see last one here hi Ryan Tana from the and and have they told you anything about Jona sorry so this was English yes yes sorry sorry uh you match with blind and and V at Ajax I don't know if you told about with them about jono or told you something I haven't spoke with him but um um yeah it's really nice to see them uh to see them again because uh I played a few years with them I played longer with with Dy than with Donnie but um it's nice to see them uh them again tomorrow so welome thank you thank you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] question in Spanish good afternoon and welcome to Jona I wanted to ask you about tomorrow's opponent you are a a guy who comes from the football World you've coached PSV also Liverpool and you have a project like the Jona football club that is very ambitious what what is for you what does it represent Jona for you or the translator made a mistake or you made a mistake but I work for Fin and not for PSV but um uh what do Jona means for me uh I think that was the question um I think it's really special what they've done here uh particularly last season but even this season still um I just made the comparison they were they were coming close to becoming the Leicester city of uh of England for for a few years ago uh they were competing for the league title with this budget probably means how how good of a manager Michelle is uh is that the way to pronounce it yeah um and uh and even this season I think they they they they do better than the results might look especially in the Champions League I've seen almost every game and apart from the PSV game where I wasn't the manager um they were in every game unlucky against par S I think they were a bit lucky against my former Club finer here at home where they conceded two own goals missed the penalty although fin missed one as well so they were in every game apart from the PSV oven one and um that's why we have to be again on top of a game tomorrow to get a result over here sorry for the mistake it was mine oh was yours okay Spanish question about the Colombian Luis Diaz Luis Diaz and how you see this healthy competition with gakpo with the dment it is a healthy competition between Louis Diaz and uh and Cody kako where um where our fans saw already a few times Lis Diaz playing as a nine as well uh in in one two games this season um we've got for the last five six seven or eight weeks four players available for free positions and um so we've we've rotated once in a while uh mostly the left wing and the nine position where our right winger has always been Mo Sal till now uh so they we've both had a lot of stars they've both been excellent for us L Diaz and Cody but uh the other two have done very well also so I'm I'm happy with with all four of them but you were asking me about the Colombian and I'm really happy with uh with Louis Diaz at uh for as long as I've been here excellent work rate big frat great footwork can score SKS so um very special player for us you're welcome hi Anna um your top of the you're top of the group at the moment um would finishing top have a significance either in terms of the seeding or in terms of Just The Prestige of finishing top when the whole of Europe's in this group yeah yeah it's so difficult to say anything about this uh I've said it many times that in the end of the season you can can judge it in the best possible way uh if it's helpful to end up first eight is it helpful to end up number one of course it seems to be really helpful to end up first eight but if you every time play your starters which we have done till now almost every time uh then you also need to results because we we also try to do this first of all to win a highest possible position but also to skip the next round uh if in the end it means by playing your STS always and um and skipping that round and still have a very difficult uh draw then we maybe uh uh are going to um uh think about it differently next season what we're going to do then in the group stage but that is something uh we have to wait and see in the end of the season where this will lead us first of all we want to uh stay at in the top eight and therefore we think we still need a win and the first chance we have is tomorrow night oh obviously Allison has traveled so is he is he fit to to start tomorrow night yes he is yeah and what kind of a difference does that make for you having him back available after was it been just over two months out H I think it speaks for itself if you can uh if you can if if if you can um play with Allison that has been so outstanding for this club for so many years and for the BR Brazil National Team that is definitely uh nice to have him back and to have him available um but if you then look at how his replacement did it's it's not going to be easy to do it even better uh so we expect uh definitely the same and maybe on margins a bit better but que did also so well that that we can say that we have two very good goalkeepers like uh our left Wingers that um that can do the job for us but um for the for so many years Ellison has been so outstanding for this club that we are expecting and hoping him to do the same in the upcoming weeks and months you said there about playing all your starters all the way through and you're in such a strong position does that lead to temptation to maybe make some changes and keep people fresh or did the game getting called off at the weekend mean that you don't have to do that yeah the last thing is for sure uh if we would have played that game then maybe we would have still played the same team as we are playing tomorrow night with but then you never know how that fixture that what people told me can be quite intense would have led to um I think it was a very good decision to cancel the game for the safety of all the people and uh if you play such a special game last last game at goodon Park it needs to be in my opinion also in good circumstances but that had nothing to do with the game being canceled but that's the that's the that's the good end result of it as well that we can now play this game in in in good circumstances but it was a very good choice uh coming from safety not to play that game so yeah now everybody is um is is really fit because we skipped the game on Saturday so there's no reason to rotate from the last match maybe there's a reason for the upcoming match but there's also three three days in between that one so um yeah we will we will start like all the other games we've started with with a very good team tomorrow good evening H tomorrow you've got an opportunity to equal a a European Club record of five successive clean sheets if my maths is correct you haven't conceded for 7 hours and 27 minutes in European football this season what have you done what have you tweaked to make such a positive change um maybe this is something to do with the new setup as well I don't know uh but it definitely has to do with the quality our players have we were just talking about our goalkeepers how good they've they've done for us till now because Ellison was a few times in goal in the Champions League and queef and we have a very good last line but it's not only our last line and the goalkeeper that keep it clean sheet it's also all the others that work so hard for it what have we done I don't think we've changed that much um uh the players are getting very good performances in and um as a result of that we've we've won games and I didn't even know but kept a lot of CLE sheets uh as well hello good evening um I'd like to know as you watch your own up um what's the main strength You observe in them uh watching the Champions League games and if someone in the squad impressed you the most among the players is someone impressed you more than the rest of J players I think their game model is what stands out their idea about football so um last season I watched quite a lot of them because I found it interesting what he did with the especially the left fullback and he's still doing the this season as well playing so inverted having such a free role from that position you don't at that moment of time you didn't see that that that often yet uh now you see some other teams doing it as well but uh that was that was interesting to see uh they have a very good idea about football always want to bring out the ball from the back uh and um yeah they have many good players but since I'm a Dutchman uh I've especially last season I liked a lot D blint how he did over here uh he got some criticism in in in in in the Netherlands at his former Club Ajax in the end so for a long time very people were very positive about him but in the end he got some criticism and if you saw him playing here last season it was uh it was daily Ben style so so comfortable on the ball uh playing balls through the lines really helping his team so um yeah they have many good players but but since he's a Dutchman I will come up with uh with him Chris and just on finishing in a top eight obviously you don't know where the draw will take you but in terms of missing that knockout round that could be a big Advantage surely in the Premier League as well because if City or Arsenal have to play that extra round that could impact in them good but um if if we end up under the top eight I assume that these clubs you were just mentioning end up in the top eight as well so Arsenal I think 95% sure City have to do a bit more maybe but they are able to win three times in a row as well so then they will be in top eight so um but you never know if it's an advantage till now we've played almost every every three days and we haven't done that bad so maybe we should uh Implement some friendly games then if we finish top eight no it's a joke of course but um it it hasn't been uh uh bad for us that we've played so many games and um but yeah we are pushing really hard to end up top eight because to have the best possible seating but definitely also to skip that round
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,JYQJPXKd9YY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYQJPXKd9YY,I'm not going to ask you about Mo's contract today that's for start I'll ask you about vels there has been a report this week that he's been offered a contract Virgil has um what can you tell us if anything what do you think the answer is going to be I know what the answer is going to be but I've always got a check every your bus is always telling you you have to have the yeah maybe tell your bus that you always get the same maner so it's a bit boring for the people to listen to the press conference what it's like you tell your players what to do so my boss tells me what to do so if your players don't do what you asked them to do but I hope I give them better uh tips than the ones you got that obviously you you've taken part in Derby before I mean it's F Sparta isn't it and obviously the classic is is f against Ajax isn't it so what you expecting from your first League Mercy side Derby particularly as it's the last Mercy side Derby at goodison Park potentially yeah I think it it's going to be special for everyone uh um for all the fans that are involved for the players that are involved and as well for the managers to be part of this game is already special than to be part of the last one on good in park makes it probably even more special um but yeah it's only a nice experience if the result if the result goes your way so um that is where we are focusing on most um for this game would it be added satisfaction to take all three points because it is the last one at goodison Park or is it purely just about three point points because of where you are in your season now uh I I I never speak about uh three points before a game you can only talk about this after the game especially if you face a team like Evan that have done so well in the last three or four games three clean sheets a very good game during the week against the wolves um so yeah we know we have to be ready for a tough game uh against a good s against a well-managed side as well so uh I'm probably def F will be loud I would say maybe just as loud as the Newcastle ones but probably these these ones are even going to be louder so uh we have to be um prepared for everything uh for this game just in terms of who you might get back is it only Allison potentially um is is he even ready yet and and just how's que as well just just because obviously I know the disappointment is at the end of the game against against Newcastle but you know he's got plenty of credit in the bank already for what he's doing this season no definitely uh it was on one nil where uh Joe Gomez made a mistake and they went one through one to semi saved it that could have been the 2N so he saved us in that moment so maybe he saved us a point because if we were going 2-n down you never know what could happen afterwards but uh things would have been even harder for us unfortunately for que and that is the position he's in if you make a mistake as a goalkeeper or you make a misjudgment is very difficult for someone else to to cover it up for you uh he's done that a few times for us if someone else makes a mistake a player he's always there to help us unfortunately we as a team we're not able to help him mostly if he misjudges the ball because he's our last player um but I think he's in a he's in a good place although he's disappointment like disappointed like all the others because we drop points from a from a winning uh situation one minute before the end but uh he can um he can go into this game with a lot of confidence let that be clear are he not ready yet though not ready yet no but he will be ready very soon an going into this mer side Derby you've got a lot of players in your squad that have experienced the atmosphere know what it's all about so to what extent do you lean on them going into a game like this uh not particularly because they've played that game but I as a manager you always lean on your players because she can make up a good game plan or a a great game idea uh but it always depends on the players if they are ready to work very hard and to uh play at their best so you always lean on your players uh not particularly in a way but in every game you play and what do you know about the mercy side Derby what have people around here told you about it people told me about it but I think the main thing I have to know is their playing style what we can expect and um yeah you need to be aggressive if you go over there uh because they will be aggressive as well but you have to be aggressive in the a smart way because uh last season we were very aggressive when we went out there because I I watched the game back yesterday and after half an hour I was I was a bit surprised because um uh Liverpool had the ball most of the time but there were 10 fouls made by the Liverpool players and only one by an Orton player so we have to be aggressive but in a smart way and um especially uh because it's they are a big threat in uh in set pieces as well so every time we we we give away an unnecessary free kick uh that is not smart so yes be aggressive but in a concentrated and Smart Way given what you said there then how do you approach this game how do you set your team up and send them out um I think we want to be aggressive on the front foot every game we play that's not going to be different now but we always make a game plan where we try to adjust uh about the threats the other team has and where we think we can hurt them so that is the way we're going to look at this game as well um but every game you want if you want to have a chance to win you need to be very aggressive and you have to run a lot and that is one of their strengths as well they're a very very hardworking team um so yeah if you want to talk about tactics you first have to match their work rate and that is what we can because we've showed that in all the games we've played till now that we are a team that works really hard as well but that's also what we need if we go to Everton because the the team works really hard and the fans of everon will probably help them working even harder uh everon have got form for targeting goalkeepers they perceive to be maybe a bit weak for set pieces they did so against Tottenham last season with Vicario and scored from a set piece do you think given the nature of the third goal on Wednesday that are you expecting some of the same from from Everton tomorrow I don't think Everton is the only team who is uh trying to uh uh block a goalkeeper or BL block the best header that is I think if we were here five six seven years ago nobody spoke that much about set pieces and we're five six years later and now every time almost everyone is talking about set pieces and the importance of set pieces and Eon is definitely a team that can score from a set piece but um we have some players that can score from a set piece as well so we are focused on the ones we have to defend but we also think about the ones we can get because big games so the ones against City the ones against Arsenal Chelsea and all the others uh are a main thing in those games are set pieces so Mercy side Derby is a big game uh so set pieces is a big part of that as well could be quite extreme weather tomorrow winds of 65 mph forecast throughout the day is that much of a consideration for you uh not at the moment but the moment it is like this you always have to be uh take this in considerations in the choice you make so um and I'm not talking about the lineup but I'm talking about the execution of um of actions of the players so if you if the wind in your back or not that can have an influence on um on certain actions you have to make um so if it is like this we take this into account but again there are many things we take into account uh before we start a game but this could be one of them um TR made significant came on in Newcastle and now it's almost impossible to replicate what he does with what what you have WR in scub so can you explain how him being in the side changes the dynamic side just with him in it to not being well first of all I think jel plays quite a good game um I I from what's been told to me not everybody agreeing with me but um uh if you just look the G look back at the game uh then you saw that that in his One V ones he had no problems uh the one the few times that Anthony Gordon was a threat he was not involved in in those moments um so U but if Connor is available I think it's it's he's a similar type than Trent when he plays as a right fullback he's also someone who tries to attack the goal wants to make the underlaps and the overlaps like you saw against Real Madrid for example where he almost scores but if we play with jel it's a different type of player so he's he's done more yeah like the way Ben whites maybe uh fills that position in he's a bit more behind the ball playing ball through the lines instead of underlapping overlapping all the time so that that makes a difference if derell plays there or Trent plays there is not that much of a difference if Connor or Trent plays there but Trent and Connor have had big big impact on our offensive game uh if they play that's for sure um exended for for this game um you're forunate that the the midfielders you've got now available have all had game time so you you you you've got options there you know to to replace them that's the good thing uh the downside to it is that I think that these players hardly make any fouls but they're already Ryan is also one card away from uh from being suspended so that is something for us to be aware of how that is possible uh because we hardly make any fouls and Miguel estana and Newcastle um yeah you could argue if you saw all the all the decisions that be made afterwards if it was so correct that he got a yellow for that but you know during a season that players will be suspended and it's it's always in moment where you feel like ah we could have used him um but the good thing for us is we've got um uh the main four midfielders that have played with dom Curtis Ryan and uh and Maka one of them is not available at the moment so still free left and Ja is on his way back so uh I think that line is not our main worry at the moment or uh but our main worry is of course I think at this moment if you look at how close they're all back up for playing time it's only three injuries left and that's in our last line with uh Joo being close to being back um fedo being close to being back and the same for Allison so that means means that only IBU Connor and Costa are a bit further away from playing time um how much extra pressure do you and the players feel being top and other teams waiting for you to slip up I think if you play for Liverpool every day you feel pressure uh because you play at a big club and everybody expects one thing from us two things from us that we win and that we play good football so um that's also the good thing uh uh that these players are used that this is expected from them so if we're top of the league or we second third or fourth people expect from us to win and people expect us to win in a certain way and that pressure is always there and I think if you play at this level if you work at this level you like this pressure for the simple reason that players are able to do what is expected from them so it's it's much harder if you for example have to stay above the relegation Zone and you in a team like it's quite hard for us to achieve this but we've got the quality to do what we are doing at the moment winning games and playing good football and uh there's always pressure If you are at a club like uh like Liverpool like at Arsenal like at city like at Chelsea I you mentioned Ryan is one yellow card away from suspension in the last three games he's had a yellow card in the first half of games um I don't know whether or not his um the fear of a second yearo played a part in his substitution at Newcastle and how do you speak to your players when as you mentioned some times the referee's decisions don't go their way but there's about finding that line of lawful aggression in games yeah we don't talk about the referee decisions uh with the players especially not after the game that's of no use sometimes they're in favor of you sometimes they maybe against you so uh there's no use of talking about that uh not over here and not with the players um when it comes to Ryan the reason why I took him off because he played every single game he played it was like almost impossible for me to take him off because he played so well you're were like oh I going take him off now what happens with the team then uh it's a bit exagerated but you know what I mean um and this game especially second first half wasn't as best like for the whole team first 10 minutes as a team we started to play better he as well but this was a game where I felt like maybe someone else can can do as a minimum the same and that will rest him a bit then as well because he's played so so so many games already and that's why we chose to um we were I think also two1 down at that moment so wasn't was maybe a smart decision to go even more offensive with Curtis as an attacking Midfield in the role as a as a number six so there were again a few factors that uh made us taking him off but he will start tomorrow
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,6TtYqqOhqd8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TtYqqOhqd8,it was a great game to watch you point to strong yeah I said many times already to to the other media that there were moments in the game where you thought oh if we can come away here with a draw that would be a good result but those moments were mainly in the first half and uh in the second half I thought we were especially after we scored the 1-1 the 1-1 yeah we were were really impressive um created so many opportunities good chances and um then in the end being one minute before the end being fre2 up it feels as a disappointment of course uh to drop two points the substitutions massive yeah I think Mo had a massive impact on the game as well uh Dom came in really well Lucho also but I think in general the second half we played much much better than the first half uh where in the first half we had a lot of problems with their intensity with their aggressive playing style without the ball aggressive in a good way um where we tried to cope with it but every time we touched them we got a yellow so that doesn't really help for us to be intense then as well uh but to give credits to them they were more intense than us they they they um they forced us to to too many mistakes so it wasn't that difficult for us to be better in the second half half with the ball and that's what we were and um yeah maybe it was difficult for them to keep the that intensity of the first 45 minutes going and as a result of that or all these things we uh we dominated the second half Tony um mentioned M there and to the other media you said you're hoping and expecting him to continue doing this for a long time um is there any updates on that and could you talk about that second half performance from from him individually I that must have been as good a one off performance from an individual as you've seen for while yeah he could score go yeah yeah it's difficult for me to predict the future but the uh the long time longterm future the only thing I can uh expect or predict is that he's in a very good place at the moment he plays in a very good team that provides him with um with for with with good opportunities uh and then he's able to do special things and what makes him for me even more special and is that in the first hour you fought like oh now before we scored to one1 you fought like he's not playing his best game today and then come up with a half hour or 35 minutes I don't know how long it was afterwards with assist two goals having a shot on the bar being a constant threat that is something not many players can do if they've played the first hour like he did uh so that is also what makes him special apart from yeah the if you if you just look at the goals his finish is so clinical it's um yeah Special player but that's what we all know generally Onan the end of last season he had an injury he had a spell where he wasn't scoring as many goals as us when you came in were you maybe slightly worried that he was perhaps going going over the hill or you been surprised by how much he's got back to his best this year um I've seen many games of last season but it's always difficult to judge a player if you're not there you just I I what I did most was just seeing style of play and uh team performance and not that much the individual performance and what I noticed from the start when he came in how fit he was how ready he was to make it a very good season for him that he leted by example from the first day onwards uh in preseason where so many of his teammates where he usually plays with so the International Players weren't there and then still be able to work that hard he did and train so hard yeah then if and and we all saw the quality from from from in in the training session so it's not surprising thing for me that he had that he does so well uh till now and there looked to be some frustration from yourself and your coaching staff directed at the officials this evening at times during the game was it one incident specifically or no well I'm not sure I think it was an intense game and uh all all the decisions are made by the players by Me by the other coaching staff and by the referee they can have a big impact so all these small details can have a big impact so you always try to influence where you can or sometimes that you have a bit of frustration but in general I didn't feel we overcross the line it's um there were moments in the game where we felt we we could have got a free kick there were moments in the game where the Newcastle bench fought they could have had a free kick yeah I think it's always like this and and it happens mostly in an intense game where there are so many turnarounds that the emotions get not only with the fans but sometimes with usse as well uh but um yeah I don't think the referee had any influence on on the results tonight last one back deed at the moment do you expect to just have slightly more Open matches now because e M's out's out Sim is out is a bit more natural to have a um Simas was already out before we played Madrid and city um Conor was out before we played City and uh and IU didn't play city as well and we kept the clean sheet two times against uh the best teams that have dominated Euro Europe for so long to go away to Newcastle it's such a such a different difficult game to play and uh um and they have so much quality uh throughout the whole Squad but especially up front as well so that they are able to score a goal that's not a surprise for me and um yeah especially the first one what a finish that was from them I mean ours was a great finish as well but uh that shot from isach I don't even know if uh if que saw that ball so hard as hard as it was thank you everyone
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,ibhnijmTg20,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibhnijmTg20,yeah that's much the time outside Anor last night Jude Bellingham said you're the best performing team in Europe so where do you rank your side when it comes to the best in Europe at the moment yeah if he talks about results uh in the Champions League so if you are number one in the Champions League in the league table then um it's true that when it comes to results we have been in the last five games the best perform pering team but I said it yesterday night already um the best team in Europe is still real Madrid because they won uh the Champions League last season and the one that's going to win it this season can say they are it they are the one that's done but at this moment of time it's only five games in for us we did touch on it last night as well obviously the injuries to Conor and ibraim is there any update as to where they're at as regards those injuries they still being a so it's difficult to see where they are I know where they are but where they are in terms of the injury um so let's let's wait and see but it's never a good sign if players Conor had to take him off and uh IU didn't walk off the pitch as he should after such a fantastic game that he played he should have uh made around um and clap to Def fense but unfortunately he couldn't so that's not a good sign obviously your eight points clear the minute Manchester City appear vulnerable given the runner form that they're on you could go 11 points clear at the same time obviously the Gap could narrow to Five Points so how significant how defining a moment could this potentially be in the title race for you uh I think in general if you play one of your competitors it's always an important moment that has not so much to do with the amount of points they have or we have uh these teams have always been the last few years very close to each other so those games are always very important uh just like the ones against Arsenal just like the ones against Chelsea but those ones are only important if you win against all the other teams so that makes it that almost every game is very important to win uh for them but also for us you just to check Anna then with um Kate and and Conor Bradley are you ruling them out of this game or do you think they've got a chance no I just said they're still being assessed and uh it's so close after the game yesterday night and I just came off the training uh training pitch so I can tell you exactly where they are um so yeah we have to wait and see um where they are this weekend and um and after that would Trent be fit enough to start do you think yes he would yeah in terms of city as well obviously Vinnie mentioned um about the Run of form that they're on do you think that makes your job easier or harder for this particular fixture no I don't think anyone uh in the last eight or nine years or maybe even longer would have said that City at home or away the word easy never comes up to my mind if I think about City and uh easier oh okay okay uh still they easy inside easier so uh uh no not at all uh and and I I know everybody's looking at their results and um I've seen them as well but if you face them and that's what we do you analyze it and then I've seen so for example against Brighton they were one to could have scored two or 3 nil didn't and then got beaten 2-1 against um um Tottenham they could have been after 20 minutes two or three goals up uh weren't and against Fino that that has has not happened many times they were freil up completely dominated the game and then uh all of a sudden in the end it was fre free so they are still a very very very good team and uh one of the reasons why I think pepu is the best manager in the world or one of the best manager world I think the best though uh is that he always comes up with solutions for his problems so um um and his problem now might be that rodri is out but we all know at least I think I'm that he will come up with a problem that the Run of form will bum go again hopefully after Sunday thank you hi Anna it looked last night like the players were pretty pumped by the atmosphere in the first half and that came along with three yellow cards and there was a moment actually where cursus Jones signaled to his teammates to maybe Keep Their Heads is that something that you are focusing on ahead of this game and what could be a similarly quite intense and good atmosphere that you need to sort of try and get your players to to watch out for those yellow cards and things like that especially if you have a yellow you have to watch out for the next one but I think one of the three was was Ryan ravenberg who made this only a simple tackle or not for a yellow but then he did this now the referees are quite keen on that giving a yellow for that so um and the first two fouls we made he also gave a yellow um I think these games you have to be on top of your game in every aspect so you have to play fair and good jewels and sometimes that can lead to a yellow card but you then if you have received one you have to be smart and that's what I saw with Ryan that's what I saw with um with Darwin as well because the one Darwin conceded was also in the set piece and they were just struggling a bit and the referee necessary to give yellow cards so uh we have to be uh on top of game we have to be aggressive but always in a good way but maybe Curtis what maybe Curtis me I don't know we have to ask him is not only without without the ball but also with the ball be a bit more calm and and and use your head a bit more because that's what we did the second half even better than the first half which led to two goals and know we've spoken about injuries and in previous games I know it's been brought up with you about injuries of the opposition and players that they might be missing do you feel that your injuries have been a bit underplayed so far this season given that you seem to have overcome them very well uh I think in general people only talk about injuries if if the results are not there so it's a good thing that nobody talked about our injuries that means that we got our results in but um the moment you start to lose it's about uh kick off time on a Saturday afternoon or it's about injuries or we always come up with certain ideas why uh especially in the media why we didn't win but nine out 10 times it's about the quality of the players from the other team or their game plan but we do have some very important players for us being injured but if The Replacements do so well it's normal that that people don't talk about it that much um but but yeah it is true um that missing Allison which has been a starter for this club and been so important for this club so long missing Joo J missing Trent in the last two games those are players that have have had impact a lot on the results in recent years but it's a good thing that we don't talk about I think thank you I just wanted to ask obviously you said that you want to restore Allison once he's fit again what's Keller's future at this club given how he's performed are you confident that he will be happy to revert to being number two or do you expect him to want to move on I'm expecting every player that he want wants to be the number one so not only in the goalkeeper position in every position and it's always up to the player if he can accept his role uh but for at this moment que has accepted his role from the start of the Season till now in a great manner um when he didn't play but also when he did play so um it's far too early to talk about what can happen next season I'm I want every player uh that they want to play every game would be completely wrong if he would have come over to me and said I like it that I'm on the bench today so um that's that's completely normal with him and all the others and um but then it's always about the attitude if you don't play and that has been outstanding for example from Lucho and Maka last Sunday when they weren't selected in the first 11 and then they come in really strong yesterday I saw the same again with uh with Dominic sa and Cody kako so um they they should uh have the eagerness to play but if they don't they have to act in a normal way and that's what they all do at the moment hi Anna um one of the Hallmarks of man City's current run is that they could been conceding goals late in games I think it's six goals in the last 15 minutes across the last three games and that's something the Liverpool haven't done all season so what are your team doing so well to avoid that adventur not playing Tottenham yet because they're a very good team as well great playing style no um it it it it always depends on the circumstances and uh them conceding free against the final probably had a lot to do with with the substitutions they made uh and being extremely unlucky so if you saw the first goal and the second goal the second goal the goalkeeper hit the ball towards the post and then it fell to Santiago gimenez um so during a season these things can happen to every team that's the same with injuries and we've seen this at Arsenal with erard being out that that didn't help them with Ry being out it didn't help City so I'm hoping we are not facing those same problems but if it does then we have to make sure it doesn't hurt us that much but it's always difficult for every manager everywhere around the world if one of your star players is injured and uh yeah when it comes to go conceded it is um it's always also the circumstances also being two nil down and then maybe taking a lot of risk and then conceding is different than being one n up and uh trying to keep a clean sheet one for the breakouts AR Man City have been struggling in recent weeks and leaking goals do you expect to change the guardiola's system to combat the loss of defensive players like rri that's what I just said I wouldn't be surprised if he comes up with another brilliant idea so I think he was the one who started playing the inverted Winger uh fullback then he was the one that started to play the center back as a number six so I don't think it's a surprise for anyone if he again comes something up with something no one has ever thought about before to make his team even stronger and that's probably one of the reasons why he inspired so many managers around the world with all these when he came up with it we all thought it was crazy then he did it and then we all thought okay let's try to do the same because it's a brilliant idea so uh I wouldn't be surprised if he comes up with with something new again um um but yeah uh let's wait and see because many things have been done in football now but uh um yeah he is if there's anyone in this uh managerial world that can come up with something new it's definitely
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,UDkZVjcyB5Y,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDkZVjcyB5Y,um and that shows you with the two positions that we're in but we also know that there's a long way to go in both competitions and you know it's not time to get carried to be I'm sure you probably knew as well that we were going to ask you something that isn't positive at the moment because Mo obviously made some comments at the weekend about not being offered a contract and that he's more out than in at the moment so I mean we saw you having a laugh with him at training but how do you feel about what he's had to say and the prospect of him going in the summer I thought that was going to be your first question on that as well yeah like honestly for us for us as players it's it's nothing that we can really get involved in all I can say is you know you look at more today you look at Mo yesterday you look you know he's the ultimate professional and In fairness it goes for all three of them you know mo viril and Trent who are all in similar positions you know every one of them is so focused on you know the next game and and training and preparing properly and you know they've been you know they've been leaders this year that's you know that's the way they've done it and I think if for us within the changing room I think if they can do that then you know we we kind of do that and we don't get distracted by anything else and they're not getting distracted and I think you know we' all just excited for the game tomorrow night you kind of touched on it as well saying there's still a long way to go but Mo also said that he's fully focused on winning the Premier League and Champions League this season haven't already been part of teams that have done both of those what do you see in this group that makes you think you could win one or both this season yeah look I think I think what we've shown is is that we can win football matches so far in this season but I also think there's a long there's a long way to go and we have to I think like you says we've you know there's a few of us have got the experience of winning both and I think you know you need a consistency you need a bit of luck along the way as well in terms of injuries and form and things like that but so far we've we've had that you know we've had good performances and maybe when we've not been at our best we've still found a way to win which is which is good but you know we're only what 12 games in the Premier League four games in the Champions League and um you know I still think there's a lot of football to be played and there'll be a lot of twists and turns and things like that but when you're in a good moment you have to you have to try and keep going and try and build that momentum and I think that's what we've been quite good at so far and we have to try and continue that because we know we've got big games coming up and you know if we can get results in them then you know our position can strengthen apologize Andy there's probably been more high-profile games against Real Madrid than this one in recent Seasons but for the development of this team do you think a win over you know a team as as strong as realid is still an important stepping stone yeah of course I think you know obviously we've played since I've been here we've played Real Madrid I think five or six times and you know obviously we've not been on The Winning Side yet but I think you know there's only a few of us that have probably been involved in that you know it's quite a different you know Squad a new Squad that you know a lot of players probably haven't faced Real Madrid with Liverpool yet and and also the same for them they're you know a new Squad new fa season and things like that so I think when it comes to these big games and you play against you know the best players and the best teams then of course you want to be one involved in the games and and until you want to get the result because you know it probably be the most watched game this week and um that's what big players want to be a part of and I think if we can get the win it just puts us in an even better position within the champions league but also you know you're beating one of your competitors which is which is always nice so we're excited by that Prospect but we also know how good Real Madrid can be and we know that they will come here full of belief and F of confidence that they can get the result and you know hopefully come you know tomorrow night we're we're the happier ones and there's someone who's been here a few years and won everything does does your leadership for the group become more important now given the situation that the the team is in as we stand this season yeah of course like I you know like I says the you know there's only a few of us that have probably experienced um you know success as in the two there two probably big trophies um and we all we all have to dip into that and we have to help the new players the younger players and things like that because it can be quite easy to get you know carried away and and start looking too far ahead but you know I think we've got enough within the changes room that won't allow that to happen and that's where you know we rely on you know probably me Virgil Mo Trent Ali Joe Gomez people like that that have been there and done it that can you know just put a cam on everything and focus on the next game cuz that's the most important so we're fully focused on tomorrow night and then come 11:00 tomorrow night we'll fully focus on Man City and then whatever happens in then we'll fully focus on Newcastle and that's just the way we work and we've always worked and I think that's what will work best for our changing room and um you know obviously we are key to that and you just think any of the lads we played in 2018 and 22 2022 still feels though you might oldow them one though for what happened it must have been one of the low points in an otherwise high career no I don't I don't you know I don't really look into you know ow people one or revenge or anything like that I think you know both games were both games were different I think 2018 was so important for our journey I think you know nobody really expected us to probably be in the Champions League final that year um and it gave us the belief that we could compete in that tournament again and go on and then win it the next year which was so important I think 2022 obviously hurt a lot more at the time with I thought we played well in the game I thought we you know dominated the game and you know their goalkeeper was man of the match which probably tells you a lot but they do what they do there's a reason why they've won the competition the most out of any team and but there's not you know I think the squad is is too new I think their squad's too new and um we're just looking at tomorrow to try and strengthen our position at the top of that table because we know how important finishing in the top eight can be in terms of you know seeding for the last 16 and not having a playoff and things like that and that's you know that's all we're focused on CH the headphones headon [Music] yeah yeah yeah don't worry I got it don't wor it was a little bit quiet but I got it don't worry um I think the question is about Trent yeah um no look Trent's you know like I said one of the closest you know friends I've got in um in the changing room he's we've kind of went on the journey together he's um he's obviously a fantastic footballer fantastic person and um and yeah you know the I think the quality speaks for himself um you know at the the top level um you know one of if not the best right back in in the world and I think he shows that year on year and probably people forget that he's still you know fairly young he's probably getting a we bit older now but he's still um he's still young enough to to get even better and I think I think that's the main thing for him he's got a a will to succeed a will to a will to learn and um you know I think you've seen that this season season as well and um yeah look he's he's a pleasure to play with um and you know obviously like it says we've kind of you know grown together within the fullback role and um you know I've enjoyed doing that with him CH next to you yeah like I think the manager and the you know the coaches that came in have been you know a breath of fresh air I think they've came in with their their ideas their new um you know there's a lot of new staff and things like that and I think you know credit to the players I think we've all bought into it I think we've all really enjoyed it and look obviously results help that you know results help breed confidence within you know the coaches within the players and I think that's you know that's one of the key reasons but also the amount of work we do on the training pitch the amount of meetings we have how many hours the the manager and the coach he's put in is um you know is incredible and they make sure that we're the best prepared possible for for every single game and it's up to us to then go out and try and play our best for them and I think more often or not this season we've done that and um you know hopefully that can continue but you know the manager and the coach since have came in have been fantastic um I think everyone's enjoyed working with them and you know hopefully that can continue one H hi Andy when for FL scor in Spain um of course the results have been very good this season so far Olivia problem and yeah so as I was saying the results have been very good so far this season um and you have said that there are many different new phases since the since the previous matches against Real Madrid H so what are the main strengths in this SC into Squad to get a good result tomorrow night thank you yeah look I think I think one I've just touched on in terms of we're playing with confidence we we've shown that we know how to win games this season um in different ways you know on Sunday we've obviously had to come from behind probably not our finest performance but we managed to find a way to win and then other times we've been able to you know keep a clean sheet other times we've been you know pretty comfortable in game so I think the confidence that the players are playing with can can help because going into a big game you want to be you want to be confident you want to feel good about yourself and and we believe in what we're doing so I think I think that is what we go into every game thinking you know we believe that we can cause any team problems and we can try and get the best out of each other and we've shown that quite a few times this season and you know hopefully we can show that tomorrow night because you know there's no bigger task than playing against Real Madrid and we'll have to bring our aame to to try and get anything out of the game and and if we do that then you know I believe we've got enough on the pitch that can that can cause him problems after last one at the back as we got the LI manager weits com in and I can try it in English Sergio errero for Cente TV Mexico you you were talking before about your leadership in the team and today in the training before H you tried while you were warming up you grabb Mo Salah to put him the first I mean like he you know him very well how how does he he feel I mean you know him well is he like maybe a little bit sad because of this situation uh it didn't look sad to me um mo mo comes into training every single day with a smile on his face he is in the gym working as hard as ever he's in on the training pitch working as hard as ever so you know in terms of that he's you know he's he's one of the happiest people in the training ground that's for sure he enjoys every moment of of being in there and I think that that can tell I think if you can find me a picture from training today but he looks sad then then fair enough but I think he looks I think he looks happy at all times and I think he's he's such a focused individual that you know he he'll be focused he'll be in his house now probably focused on on tomorrow night and that's that's the main thing that's what all good players do that's what all the best in the world do and and most certainly falls into that category thank you thank you any first couple yeah I think you probably expect what's coming next um obviously there were a few quotes from Mo at the weekend saying that he hadn't been offered a new contract and he's more out than in at the moment so how do you see the situation and what are you being told about how contract negotiations are going uh indeed people tell me about this but I've said many times we don't share this over here at least I don't share this over here um the only thing I can say is if I look at my lineups MO is more in than out um so uh that quote I can give you that said though when a player speaks out like that armor does it cause an issue in terms of a distraction when it comes to big games like like this and is there a genuine fear from yourself that you could lose mod in the summer now because his numbers are obviously still up there where you would want them to be yeah definitely we want his numbers to be where they are at at the moment because those are the numbers Mo always have had and still has so that's the positive thing I don't think he's extra distracted at all I haven't seen that after United game where he had some comments I haven't seen it after uh a post you told me about after was he just kept on scoring I didn't see anything today he's just fully focused on the game tomorrow and I think these kind of things are inside here and probably in the media and all our fans talk about it which is completely normal but if you would have been a the EXA today I don't think any any player talked about it at least that's when I was there maybe they they always give each other a bit of stick uh so maybe they did this now as well but players are also are focused on the short term and that's Madrid and that's uh and that's City and uh By the time most contract most cont is extended players don't look at it that way we as a club of course do but the players don't so I don't think there's any distraction at all for him or for the players and definitely not for me because I worked yesterday on uh preparing the team in the best possible way and it was not one time in my mind that I thought oh I'm sitting here tomorrow talking about Mo thank you TR an what does Liverpool Real Madrid conure up in your your mind it's a big European Clash what what what's your feeling about this game yeah it's a it's it's a big game um I think uh uh Real Madrid Manchester City dominated Europe and the league for a few years now uh combined with Liverpool because Liverpool was always up there as well competing with these two clubs so it's a special uh week for us especially because we played two times at home but uh if this week is done again the big week is coming up with Newcastle away and Derby side Mercy side Derby side Mercy side Derby so um if you if you are at Liverpool you always play big games but yeah these two are special because these three clubs have dominated the league in Europe for so many years recently so that's a special week to play I will ask the question in English you're extremely popular here the results have been amazing in the first couple of months um can you tell something about how it has been for you the first couple of months here and what is the reason you think of the great success you're having in the first months as Liverpool manager I think I'm extremely popular in Holland as well aren kind of no only in only in Rotterdam um no results have been really good and results are always done by the players and if they have very good result that always is good for the manager and for the Press officer and for everyone who works at the club so um but we also know how much effort we have to put in to win these games and that's why we always have to give credit to the players that put these efforts in to get these results um and as a result of that players are popular like you just heard because MO is quite popular over here and um and maybe the manager that is part of that results as well f k for now yes because they play City and we play City on Sunday so I definitely going to look uh City against finals you're coming up against one of the the great managers of this era in Carlo angelotti your thoughts on facing him and what would it mean to you especially given how well you've started here were you to beat one of the best tomorrow that you have to ask me after the game if we were able to win from them but that that is a very difficult thing not only for Liverpool but for every Club that has played them in Europe because they can win in so many different styles in so many different ways that's the better way to uh to put it that's why they won this competition so many times because they can win to be really dominant and outplay the opponent but if it's a difficult game they always find a way to win the game or to go to the next round and that's what makes them special uh also of course because they are always having great great individual players great quality but that's the nicest thing of tomorrow that's why it's so busy over here because Liverpool has some great players at the moment and for recent years as well so that's why we're all looking forward to the game tomorrow are you able to give this game full 100% Focus given there is another huge one against Manchester City to come will that be on your mind at all in the next 24 hours I think the answer was uh Sunday against Southampton where you could argue if you if the next game is room the next game is city are the players really ready to perform uh or are they looking at the next game no they didn't of course I know we conceded two goals but if you look at those two goals the effort we did to prevent the other team from scoring was there we were in both situations a bit unlucky but the moment Robo made the tackle I think there were six or seven players from us around the ball the moment they scored the second one there were eight players from us inside the RO 18 yard box so we are not distracted by next opponents we're only focused on the next game and that is now Real Madrid um yeah if you then look at the next one that I don't think any football player would do that everybody just enjoys it to play tomorrow against Madrid especially here at anfield hi an um this is the fourth consecutive Champions League campaign that Liverpool faced Real Madrid and fifth out of the last seven times and as Andre Robertson referenced when he was sitting up there a minute ago Liverpool haven't won any of them in that time when you're trying to plan for this game do you go back to some of those games and maybe pick out some of the positive moments for example Kate's performance in the 2022 final or maybe even going two nil up in the last time they came to anfield or do you just draw a line under it all try to get rid of all the potential emotional psychological badage and just say it's a brand new game start from scratch you've told me so many things that I only thought is this all your questions always an effort to replace me in the future because the know you have about in the future and data is enormous uh I wasn't aware of the fact that we played them so many times I was aware of the fact two years ago uh they were if I'm correct I say they because I was not part of it but we were two n up I think and uh I think I even used that game to my team at final at the mo at that moment saying Madrid always finds a way of winning that game because the moment when it was two n up there was no one that would have expected that that game would end up being 52 from Madrid but that is what makes them so special that they can turn games around like that but they can also take the ball tomorrow and just dominate you from the start and yeah probably one of the reasons is that they have a great manager for years already and they have great individuals as well and that makes them one of the best maybe their best club in the last five to 10 years in Europe Lo i h just check on team news is saw Tren in training today is he ready to start and then a few of the others Federico like to those sort of people yeah it's funny that you talk about our injuries because most people only ask about the injuries R have uh but we also have a few recently um Trent is in the squad but he will not be available to start he can maybe make a few minutes uh in an ideal world he maybe doesn't uh but if it's really necessary he can he can make a few minutes uh tomorrow but he's not going to start and then fedo is not in the squad yet he's training with us then in in not not the whole session but mostly one or two parts of the session ja is in the team but hasn't played for a long time uh competitive football so he's there but of course not ready to start Allison is not there yet Joo is not there yet do I forget anyone Costas Costas is not there yeah he's um he's having an injury as well so it's quite a list for us as well yes definitely uh we approach it differently because uh a new player is going to play for him with different qualities so we knew when when fenici would have started I had to prepare them for him and mbappe and all the others but they are probably the main attacking threat for them now with him not playing we have to expect something else and I think he played almost every game for Madrid so it's again quite difficult for us now to understand what we can expect but what we do know what we can expect is 11 players with great quality and we Tred to prepare them in the best possible way but yeah Will Bellingham play as a 10 will will he play from the left will he play from the right will andri come in will ker start so they have so many options which now is a bit more difficult for us to see what they're going to do if fishes would have been fit I think I could have come up with their lineup now it's going to be a bit of a surprise for us maybe but um the thing we do know is that we play 11 great players and a very good team just got time for a couple more the jum the blue top AR those are a lot of questions about the team we face and my opinion about them the only thing I can tell you is I'm I'm not bothered about what is his best position the only thing I'm bothered about is his quality and we have to face that quality and we have to play him in the best possible way but he's shown so many times that he's so difficult to defend uh for his country for man also for Real Madrid he's one of the best players the football has at the moment so um yeah uh if phishes would have played that would be the second one uh one of the best players the football has at the moment so now it's mbappe who's still there and um yeah I'm not the manager of Madrid so it's not up to me what is his best position or not I think every position he plays in every position he plays he's one of the best players in the world so we have to be ready for him yeah AR for um you're in the shape of your life speaking perfect English with everyone you're winning the fans are singing uh it's beginning to look a slot like Christmas what do you experience from this did you know that no I didn't didn't know good to know um but how much do you experience that yourself and how big are the nures for tomorrow um like I just said I didn't noce and I don't follow uh how popular I am if I am or not the only thing I bother about is the next opponent and that's Madrid and how to prepare the team in the best possible way like I've said many times so that's my main focus now my family is coming over so if I hurry up a bit I have to do some groceries for them as well uh and then uh and then go home uh and and and that is where my my main focus is and not about the songs they sing for me uh although it sounded quite nice um but it's nice to be in this position it's nice to work at this club and it's nice this week it was nice last week and it will be nice next week as long as we keep on winning just one here then the final one car Anna I just wanted to ask you one more about Mo Salah um Jamie carer said that Salah was selfish for for speaking out and that he should have been fully focused on Liverpool Football Club just wonder what you made of that comment and I know you said that he's not distracted and it's not a distraction for Liverpool but I just wonder if you have any concern as well as to whether it might develop into a distraction if Salah continues to express his disappointment publicly I focus a bit more on what else he said he said that he was one of the five best players Liverpool ever had and I completely agree with him which is not an easy thing because we had so many great players at this club so uh I don't think it's um it distracts Mo at all um maybe brings even the best out of him if you look at his performances uh till now so um like I said already a few times my main focus is the next game and if we had that game another big game is coming up and if he had that game just keeps on going so uh I talk to Mo about what I expect from him and um and and and like I do with all the other players and uh he's in a good place at the moment and I said before I'm not distracted At All by his commands and I don't feel his teammates do so um it's nice that we have a story in the media so you guys have some work now as well last one Carl yeah hurry up I have to do the groceries you um you spoke about the way Madrid always found a way to win do do Madrid carry a different aat of the teams do they they bring a psychological advantage into European games I think um I think they might do I I I I cannot talk for all the other teams they face but uh I said to my when I worked at my former Club many times that we should take the example of Madrid that they always find a way to win they can win it in different uh ways if it's difficult for them they can still win a game and that's what's probably one of the reasons apart from them having so much quality that they uh won this tournament a lot um so yeah uh I think I can only speak for myself but maybe the players might feel the same if we are fortunate enough to be one a goal up or even more up we still have we still are aware of the fact especially because what we've experienced two years ago that the game will never be done till the referee blows his whistle in general it is like this but I think we all feel it against Real Madrid a bit more than to some other clubs we face thank you
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,oHpxw_xxPS4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHpxw_xxPS4,your assessment of the overall performance what really made the difference for you in that second half um like many times now uh managers change their game plan when they come to anfield or when they play us that's also what we saw uh today uh I've never seen and I see quite a lot and my staff as well if we go into a game like this so we've seen a lot of games from liver but I've never seen bony bony face or the way you say it to pronounce it playing from the left uh uh so they played without the nine and um that's why they overloaded the Midfield a lot so it was quite difficult to press them High and um but the good thing was that we we we hardly conceded anything and I think during the first half if there were chances they were for us but second half we could adjust to the game plan of the first half we took a bit more risk we were better with the ball as well so um normally they defend more in a 523 now they defended in a 44 two as well so they they changed quite a lot uh and we could adjust that at halftime and it proved to be some decision to play le as through the middle as well re rewarded with a hattick his first hattick for Liverpool what was the key element in deciding to play Lewis as the as the main man through the middle yeah a few things uh I only have four four attackers available at the moment with the uh with the injuries of Joo J and Federico kza uh and Darwin didn't play that much in the beginning then he out to play a bit more but yeah with with this fixtion list you can you yeah it's almost impossible to play them all especially if you haven't start played that many games before so that in combination with the fact that I think tah who is a real good Defender and is one of one of the best defenders in um in Germany maybe the best defender in Germany and he likes to maybe to play more against the target man someone who's there in the middle and uh we chose uh to to to play luo Mo from left or to the Midfield and then uh maybe surprise him afterwards with runs in behind not only him but in general and um yeah if you look at the first goal that paid out but uh what a pass from Curtis Jones but is it something you could do more regularly playing Lewis in that role if we have our injuries like we have at the moment then then then this could could happen yeah but um that also depends on who's available and and and how the other team lines up what the formation is but last season I think if both of them played Cody kako and Lucho Diaz then it was more Cody who played as a nine and Lucho as a as an 11 um and that's also a possibility but but then we maybe had again this height from Cody against T instead of uh someone who's a bit more versatile and drops into the Midfield one here H hello it's Valentina P for J Radio col colia of course in Colombia we care about Lucho and there's this dispute between gako and Lucho and Lucho replies with a hatrick uh we might be seeing him more often in the starting 11 or how would you say after this great Lucha performance first hot trick here in anfield and actually first hot trick for Liverpool in Champions League since 2017 yeah not only the people in Colombia like and love Lucho uh the fans of Liverpool love him a lot as well I heard many times the fan singing his his song and the manager likes him a lot as well I don't love him but I like him a lot um he's played many many games but I just said something about Darwin Nunes in in the Premier League and the Champions League you have to play so many games at the highest level and it's not always possible for every player to play every game especially in certain positions so if you're a center back normally you run not as much as a left Winger or a fullback or a midfielder and especially our Wingers but because you always you all look at the goals luo scored and the goals Cody scored but I also look at the fact how hard they track back how much they have to defend and um I ask a lot from them so that's why sometimes we have to rotate them but Lucho for me is a starter and I said this three days ago about Cody as well he's for me a starter also James just oh oh oh hi honor um you're making this look pretty easy does it feel that way no no no not at all but therefore uh I think um then you only look at the results but Brighton last Saturday was um was a difficult one uh where we were one nil behind we had to fight really hard and I think that's also what you saw today we have to work really hard play with Incredible high intensity uh to win our games and that has a lot to do with teams I heard by liver saying this as well they they think and I I think I have to agree with them that anfield is the is the best place to play in one of the one of the nicest stadiums to play in and against a very good team so every team that plays against us is on the top of their uh game and if you want to win that you always have to be consistent in your intensity and that's not always easy uh but that is what needed and if we can keep reducing that then it's still not easy but then we get our wins in and that is what we want some this it's actually a record you've set no new premier league manager has ever won 14 out of 16 in all competition so you're top of the Premier League top of the you're top of the champions league as well is that is that pressure or is that something that that you welcome I think if you work at any club in and around the world there's always pressure so for some clubs or for some manag there's pressure not to go down for some they have to win a lot so in our position there's always pressure and this is the pressure we give ourselves as well because if you work at Liverpool or if you play at Liverpool as as as a player or as a manager uh you know um the manager that's probably going to come next uh and so many other great players has set the standard so high over here that that all always feels as a bit of pressure but we also Embrace this because that's also what we want we want to be there where we are now we want to compete for everything and uh therefore you have to accept that if you work here or play here that there's pressure but the other side is that if you work up player you can enjoy incredible uh evenings uh and enjoy it uh because today the atmosphere I said last Saturday po this was impressive I think this was even more impressive today go hi Arna you mentioned consistency of intensity there yet there seems to be so many games where Liverpool suddenly go from controlled to go several gears is that planned or is it something actually you would like to see more of the later stages in games no I would love to see this from the start uh but the other team Dan normally has because if the game starts everybody is still very fit and uh uh and there's a lot of intensity from both sides and what I like to until now that we are able to keep producing this energy and even go a gear higher and that in some situations uh led to the fact that the teams we face not all of them but a few of them had some difficulties with that intensity but preferably we start like this from the start but like I said you have to give credits to the opponents we play Brighton had a very good game plan uh on Saturday chab Alonzo we all know this from him had a very good game plan today as well which made it difficult for us in the first half but even even if it's difficult for us and not difficult in terms of them getting a lot of chances but difficult in they have a bit more ball possession than what we would like we still don't concede a lot and that has a lot to do with u with the work rate the players put in here hi Arne uh Curtis Jones uh picked up the assist for the first goal he's been a very key player for you in terms of goals and assists what kind of midfielder would you say is number 10 number eight number six and what would you put behind him seemingly being more attacking this season and seems to be getting in amongst the goals and assists more yeah I think many of them have a lot of goals and assists so um but um I still learn uh uh on a daily basis um uh about every player but Curtis is one of them when I started off I thought he was I first game I played him as a six uh which you didn't see because it was behind closed doors um but that that was that wasn't his best game in general from us but for him as well I think he can play and that's one of his qualities I at this moment he can play in every position because he just um he's in a very good place at the moment so comfortable on the ball so you can trust him closer to your defense but like we saw against Chelsea and I saw today as well he's also able to penetrate inside the 18 yard box and give and giving the last pass so um he's um he's really made a step up after preseason and that's also why he gets his chances now because if players do well and I have quite lot of them at the moment uh they will get their chances last one all the way over here sorry Hi AR congrats for the win um I also heard your song at the end of the game what does it mean to you personally that you had such a successful start here at anfield and that people appreciate you a lot no it's always better for a manager that this happens than uh when they start to boo um so um it's special I think it was um it was special from the start and and therefore I think I have to thank yugan because he was the one that came up with the song and um yeah it's always special if you are a player if they sing they sing for you but yeah some players get used to this I'm not so they only sing a few times for me in my playing career but uh that that is what you see a bit more sing people singing for a manager is not that common at least not in Holland maybe here it happens a lot so it was nice to hear today but I also liked it a lot uh that after after that they sang for chabi as well because uh he's been so special for this club so he deserves this for this but also his achievement at liver kusen uh champion last year won the cup played the final in Europe um so for all these reasons he deserved um the fans to sing for him as well
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,70UEDjuLeA0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70UEDjuLeA0,honor before we talk about Liverpool can I just get your thoughts on Eric tenh har obviously leaving his position as Manchester United manager and rud vanis Roy taking inter in charge yeah you can of course um he's a Dutch manager so that makes it uh even harder for me for us uh as Dutch people um always your first four thoughts are with the person uh we are we are all in this job so we know that it can happen but if it happens it um especially because I know him a little bit and I know how much work he puts into it and um then to get this news for him is of course uh a Pity and um but we also know especially us coming from Holland how well he did at Ajax and that he won two trophies over here so we will see him uh I think in the near future somewhere at a big Club again but at this moment it's for him and his family it's of course uh yeah tragedy is maybe a bit too much to say but it's a big disappointment for your squad at the moment jot ker Connor Bradley are they likely to figure how far away are they from from a return uh the ones you just mentioned Connor is training with us again so uh he could maybe um be in a squad tomorrow J not Allison not uh javey Elliott not and federo I'm not expecting him to be in the squad tomorrow as well how long do you think for Federico uh that that's always difficult to say because he goes a bit up and down so sometimes he's there with train a few days and then uh uh he he goes out he goes out for an injury again so um I don't want to uh put uh days or weeks on it because uh I think we just have to make sure he gets in the best possible shape and uh don't put any pressure on him by coming up with dates just looking at this competition the game you've already played obviously a starting lineup from the win over Bournemouth only kellerer and Nunes then started the cup win over West Ham then from West Ham game only then jot started the league win over wolves so How likely are you to do something kind of similar with regards to team selection this week bearing in mind it's also a double header against Brighton yeah I don't think it's possible to do the same as we did against West Ham for the simple reason that we got some injuries so we don't have uh uh maybe enough players to change them all if I wanted that um we've played on Sunday against Arsenal yesterday there was mostly recovery for everyone but today when we come in and we and they have to come in uh as we speak we will find out how they all are and then we have to make a decision who's going to start but um I think if you look at our schedule and the amount of times that we have less days to recover compared to our opponent that's um that's not on Saturday because we play Brighton uh tomorrow but Brighton played Saturday and and and with um with liver it's the same they play Friday we play Saturday so it might be a moment for us to also see some some other players but like I said we have to um I first have to know how fit everybody is hi um can I just ask as well this starts I think it's five games in around 11 days how do you prepare for that and and does that mean you have to sort of Select games that have more prominence uh no I think always the next game is the most important uh so uh you try to bring to to pick a team to select a team that is best cap capable of winning that game and sometimes that means because they've played so many games you change one or two or a few more players how to prepare them for that is not that's not what you do today or tomorrow that's mostly what you've done already in preseason and all the weeks leading up to this schedule those are the weeks you try to prepare them for these weeks and you do this by training sessions of course Endo came off the bench and I know we started the previous round in this competition is this a chall for him to maybe start and also when you're making these changes how do you keep those players that are maybe struggling for minutes happy in the squad the last thing is not always easy because they all want to play and it would be strange for me if they are all happy if they don't play but they are professionals they know that these things can happen and they also see that the players that play in their position do really well so that is mostly with Vata but it's also with Joe Gomez and Geral kwansa that are in compet comption with Ryan with with IU and with feril so they understand and they see how well these players play and that they also stay fit till the last minute of the game um but I think wat is one of the players that that might be in the lineup because um for because the season is going to be so long and he and we will need him during the season and therefore he needs once in a while playing time as well um he fortunately has this playing time with the national team but it helps if he once in a while gets came with us again and I really liked him against West Ham and what I admire about him or what I respect about him is his personality because two times he had to come in five minutes before the end and in my manager career I sometimes have seen that players if they come in five minutes before the end they come in with a face like this and play like that but uh every time when we need him even if it's for five minutes he shows up for the team for his teammates and for himself so um I think he uh also for that reason he deserves to play tomorrow yeah tomorrow yeah uh you mentioned after the Arsenal match your admiration for Darwin Nunes and his ability to come in and play three games after not having played a lot and to play with such energy and aggression you also kind of mentioned he was the only recognized Striker available so with that in mind I was wondering about some of the other options uh we saw Cody gako played 15 minutes at the end of the game against leig but he seemed to have been a little bit more rejuvenated in his old left wing role we've also seen Lis Diaz and mosala play centrally during their Liverpool career I noticed Jaden Dans was walking into the building earlier today I wonder whether or not he's comeing to play if he's training with the first team this year you could become the manager over here or do we have any other option to play as a nine as well because you given me a lot already but I mean I'm not offering my own Services that's for sure okay I don't know that smart um uh no I think about Darwin I think uh I gave him credit for the fact that he worked so hard in previous weeks where he didn't play a lot to be able to play three times in a in in a row uh in I think three three games in eight days so that says a lot about him but it also says a lot about the quality of our performance staff and medical staff uh that we were able to um to give him the right sessions to prepare him in the right way but you always need the player to buy in because you can give him the right sessions but if he doesn't give everything then it's very difficult for him to do what he did so um also with him it was for it was a good thing that his ban for the Uruguay team uh uh uh was cancelled so he could play their two games that helped probably as well for him to play the way he did and I'm not talking about the quality he played with but with the intensity he played with and the quality was also good so there was a positive thing yeah it is a Pity that um that Joo jotta is not available and fedo kesa is also not available because they were in my opinion the most logical number nin maybe not in yours but uh uh but still we have some other options with the ones you just said anym do you expect J to be back before the November International break no after that and ell at the same ear the same yeah and just just on ker there's some reports in Italy at the end of last week saying that they might try and get him un Loan in January is that ever I mean seems fairly NE need J to that hasn't gone through my mind at all I think the first and foremost is that he gets fit again and then we can see uh where he is and I think there were also reports in in in in in Italy what I meant about him was that he missed preseason and in preas season that he was on low intensity sessions because he had to train with three or four players apart from the group uh so um that is uh what I said and then going from there to the to a high intensity League to a high intensity playing style uh is difficult in general for every player but especially if if you had a preseason like this so we knew this before so we knew we had to be really careful and adjust where we could uh to H to his individual needs but it hasn't been perfect yet so we're trying to find the right way of building him up without overloading him and that is has been difficult till now but I have the fully confidence that that will happen and um let let him first be fit just a goalkeeping situation an do you look do you look to keep Kell in this competition or do you give j a chance it's something that also goes through my heart and I haven't made the decision yet so we will see tomorrow um there also a decision you take also you include your goalkeeper coach with that but in the end I have to make that decision and I um I also want to hear how fit the que is at the at the moment he played many games so um let's wait and see what decision I make tomorrow and at the weekends MV made two unbelievable saves don't know you seen and he was there the Balor last night how have the club been tracking his progress before he joins next summer I assume the club follows his uh prog uh progress uh uh very detailed because I know how professional this club is if you ask me I'm in a program from game press conference PR press conference sometime have some time to train with the boys as well so I I wasn't able to see his game uh during the weekend but it's good to hear that he made some good saves but I not surprised to hear that because uh we knew that we bought a very good goalkeeper with him just going to ask what you s the main threats from Brighton will be tomorrow um very good idea about football for many years already so I like their playing style a lot with their former manager already and and and and and and with this one as well and I think um what makes the club Brighton in my opinion special is that um maybe not the most money in the league when they buy the players but they always find the right ones so there's a lot of quality uh although uh also for them the transfer fees go up a bit but they are not spending 100 million on a player so they always find the right ones and uh so many quality players uh to pick and a very good playing style um just on obviously the Cup's a chance to use young players sometimes um you obviously used a lot of allowed lot of them to go out on Loan in the summer to to maybe get game time but when you do get injuries and you're looking at the squad is that the difficult balance to try and know how many to let go and how many to sort of keep around the building yeah yeah that is sometimes difficult because uh in certain situations you would prefer to keep them here because then they can train every day with you and you can you can Implement in the best possible way your playing style but if that also means that they hardly play that will normally also lead not to the progression you are hoping for so that is the balance we always try to find with our players also with our very talented ones then and then sometimes that means you you bring them on a loan Stephan B was a very good example to that and uh then you hope to see that he plays a lot and he already played a few games um and then it's very pleasing in this particular situation that he went to a very good manager as well with papine less that uh that knows this club also so and for Bok it's similar also went to a very good manager and if to a very good playing style so it's a balance we need to find do we want to play them on a regular basis or once in a while and keep with us and we have to keep uh we have to be aware of our own interest so we can't let everybody go that doesn't play all the time and there Tyler is a good example of that which is a Quality quality player uh good enough to play everywhere uh around the league but is in competition with so many good midfielders over here but yeah like you see now we our we've got six forwards two of them are injured only four left and with the schedule we have that's sometimes a bit of a worry for me so maybe we should bring B do back
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,ora8wd_bWZc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ora8wd_bWZc,on a slot as you see we have simultaneous translation D said he's comfortable answering questions in German or English um if you'd like to ask a questions please raise your hand okay thank you you want to start hold on James Dominic how how do you feel as it the the season has started for you personally you happy with your own form with my own one um it can be always better so um no I I can uh I can play even better I can as the GFA said I can score more goals I can give more assists um but um I'm doing uh the dirty job as well for the team and that's the most important for me until we at the top of the league and I don't score no goals I take it how has your role changed do you think with the change of manager your your role how has that changed um I just answer the question before um it's almost the same um I can play a little bit higher as I did uh last season I have a little bit more offense role um that's I'm happy happy with it um but otherwise it's it's it's the same B in front Le hi Dominic um H as obviously you just said there about you need to score more goals What specifically doing on the training ground I know there's a lot of meetings and video sessions and stuff to try and get into better positions to score more goals what are you changing up it's not only about uh training sessions and videos uh of course it helps a lot but um it's in the situation in the game it's totally different so even if I score in the in the trainings you can ask the guys I score couple of good goals um but still in the game is is um is not the same I'm trying to work on it to be in the position so I can score more goals but um yeah even if it's uh take time I will I will get there one at the front here and you just wait for the mic thank you hello Dominic uh just wondering on your thought about coming back to your old club and and what type of reception do you expect tomorrow night I'm happy to be back um can't can't wait to get uh to the stadium tomorrow to see to see my old friends um coaching stuff as well and also the fans um I couldn't say really a goodbye to them um because the my last transfer was a little bit quick um U how they going to do I'm to be honest I don't know I know their players I don't know who going to play but um yeah a great team uh also very good start of the season six games um considered no goals so yeah we have to be ready lady in the green it's going to be German hello welcome back the coach said that they're missing you you Club will work for Red Bull you know liick you know Red Bull the all customers what can Jurgen Club bring to liick and red Bullman [Music] um well I also heard that he will start from the 1st of January working for RB I think it's little bit different different job for him compared to being a coach he needs to take care of many things but I'm happy that he's back in football because such a name as he has you can't forget and you don't want to forget about him and it's good that he stays in football J in front the white coat other side hell oh Dominic welcome back one and a half years you experienced Liverpool the myth you a good good form what do you think about the match tomorrow playing here away and how do you look at leik they can make it this season to reach good objectives well as you said one and a half years just went by so quickly and I played many matches already for Liverpool I'm very happy about it but I worked hard for it and uh I can only be thankful to leig and to my previous clubs and to the other question well I think that I said before that they have chance to win the Bundesliga title and I hope for them that they can make it actually they won the dfb poal the German cup they won the Super cup and uh only one trophy is missing and why not this year it could happen this season Dominic welcome back brother um one question I have for you is how have you grown as a player and as a person since leaving RB liick as I said before it was a quick one and a half year um but yeah I left I came here as a as a as a young young talent and left as a as a grown man and now playing in the Premier League learned a lot of stuff uh playing under under urgen or under um Arna is gave me so much stuff uh what I didn't know before that um that shows that you can always learn something from from different coaches and also the players I'm playing with um Can Only only say positive stuff and um you learn every day something and that's that's what I'm looking for John M Dominic when you said that you're doing the dirty job how did you feel when you found out you were going to have to do the dirty job um well last year I was uh I was doing the same so it's not new this season as well um but of course uh as I said before I'm going to do it all the time for my team until we succeed and then doesn't matter for me if I if I don't score then until we are top of the table that's the most important last one there Chris Dominic I remember speaking at the start of last season you said Liverpool were going to win everything you went quite close towards the end how would you feel about this season is that your ambition again win a lot well I said it I said it before I will not answer answer these questions anymore um because last season didn't work out so now we are looking for game by game and um seeing what's happened also uh we have two cups in the in England uh we have the Premier League also you can compete against the best teams in the world so and you still have the Champions League so yeah we are looking forward to it and we want to we want to achieve a lot of things and um but let's see what what we are able to do thank you everyone [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] this one um yes don't that you I don't think he drank it but it was there um same process as previously if you'd like to ask a question please wait uh raise your hand and wait for the microphone any want to kick us off James honor um Diego jot obviously hasn't made the trip um what's the assessment on him since he was forced off at the weekend is it clear now exactly the extent of the injury and how long he'll be out for Connor Bradley didn't make the trip Harvey Elliot didn't make it uh fedoa didn't make it and Allison didn't make it so it means that we have um a few issues at the moment moment uh he got a he got a knock like we all saw when he was uh trying to go to goal uh brought down that was not the biggest problem but I think the other player fell on to him and that was uh uh that hurted him that much that he couldn't continue to play and he and he couldn't come with us for now and it's difficult to judge uh at this moment of time to see how long that's going to take he tell somewhere over here so it's uh it's it's Bruce is that the way to say it so uh we have to see how long it's going to take clis you mentioned those issues piling up and the fixtures keep coming and coming is that put a bit of importance to go and get another positive results tomorrow night with all these games coming that you can get your qualification done in as soon as possible in this group stage I've I've never I never think it's a good idea to lose a game so uh no matter where you are in the season it's always better to get the best possible results and that's also what we're trying to bring in tomorrow uh we look at it game by game and we try to bring out the best possible team for tomorrow for for the for the competition we fac with leig we're doing really well in the Bundesliga had the difficulty of playing two very difficult teams in the Champions League that's the difficult thing of this format that after two games you can have a league table that doesn't tell the whole story because you can face teams from pot four is also you call it pot four or group four group four group four or you can face the difficult ones in the beginning and that's what they had uh so uh very good team and um yes the fixtion list is stuff but what would you expect if you play champions league and Premier League the fictionist then is stuff and that's what we like that's what we want so we have to deal with it and we like to deal with that John Mur just here an you mentioned the the single League concept have you have you got your head around it now and what do you think the the concept of this Champions League it's I I got my head around it but I I don't think you can have a fair opinion yet because we're only two games into the Champions League now if you ask if you would say to me okay tell me what you think about it because I want to have an answer I would tell you okay I like it but that has only to do with us having six points out of two games that has nothing to do with the format so we have to wait and see uh what the end result of this format is and you can only judge that after uh the group stage is done and then see if if me or you or the fans uh liked like this new format do you think it will be an incentive further down the line if things continue to go well to cast a thought ahead to what your seeding might be in The Knockout stages or am I looking too far ahead now what you're doing is using quite difficult English words so I need a translations for this now if if we keep on going like this is that what John ask explain that in the in the table will determine potentially which side of the drawer you'd be in in the in The Knockout stages that's true yeah but we don't know the other teams that are left and right so um we all can come up with certain teams you don't want to come up against immediately after you go through to the next round but first you have to go through to the next round but you don't know if they end up one two three or they lose a few games in the meanwhile so that is the difficulty of this format although when it's just a draw you also don't know who you're going to face uh although maybe it's a bit then you know you're going to face it the number two or the number one now now you just don't know so it's so difficult for me to say if I like this or not if I think if if we reach the next round and the draw is good for us then I definitely like it let's wait and see L Hi H just going back to the injuries you say Connor and um Federico how if you got a time scale on those are they Ser serious I know feder Rico has been out for a few weeks but are they going to take a while to recover or are they just Min it I think it's that is always so difficult with injuries especially if it's if it just happens it's so difficult to see where they are uh after a few days and I think after a few days you can better say where they are with federo it's it's a bit more simple although it's more difficult but it's bit more simple to explain he missed a complete preseason I said this many times and and going to a a league where the intensity might even be higher than uh than than um than the Italian League we just faced the two Italian teams so it's I can say this now um so that makes it difficult for him to make the step towards the intensity levels the rest of the team is at at the moment that has not so much to do with the Italian League or the Premier League but that has more to do with him missing a complete preseason and then it's so difficult for every player to when the games are constantly there to build them up toward where the levels we are at so difficult to say but it's a big disappointment for him uh that he is going in and out uh of the training sessions all the time so feel sorry for him and but he he he he signed a long-term contract so we will we will see what he brings for us but at the moment unfortunately for him he can't uh he's been us one or two times I think in team selection and not more than that Chris a great start and the threshhold that the standard you set is so high but what is it particularly you're looking for more because you can tell that you're still looking for more and more is anything particular that you're that you're looking for from the team because you're top of the league you're winning all these games yeah yeah you can't ask for much more when it comes to results but when it comes to what we want uh uh there's always room for improvement uh I don't think we outplayed Chelsea uh we certainly didn't I think they were more dominant than us with the ball so in an Ideal World I would have seen us dominating the complete game like we did so many other games we are not there yet but the good thing about this team and about our result was that if you face a team like Chelsea or man united because we had difficult moments in the United game as well that you see a team that's fighting for every every centimeter every meter fighting for every moment that can be decisive in the game and that's what we showed but uh I'm hoping that in the future hopefully in the near future we play a difficult game like the Milan game or the United game that we are more dominant uh than we were against Chelsea but probably that says a lot about Chelsea as well because I said it before the game and I can I said it after the game and I can say it one more time a lot of people in England in the start of season made a bit of fun about them investing so much money and all these players that were not in the in in in the squad but in my opinion they've done in the last one or two years really well bringing so many talented players in and now having such a strong Squad with such a good manager that they will be up there in the upcoming years that's my opinion and uh let's see if I'm right
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,RLoW-8oewP8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLoW-8oewP8,uh Anor uh chance to go four points clear obviously we can look at the situation as Liverpool having the opportunity to put pressure on those chasing you at the top of the table but how do you see it particularly with those games coming against Chelsea and Arsenal after the international break uh yeah you always look at the first one and that's Crystal Palace and um I think they already shows how tough of an opponent they are against the big teams like United and Chelsea in both situations they got a results so uh that's the first uh game and and that's why it's the most important one and the difficult one for us 12:30 kickoff after playing at Wednesday evening late in the Champions League facing again a team that has a whole week to prepare but that is part of working at a at a top club that uh that we we face those teams and we have to be ready for those teams and that's what we are tomorrow and I don't look at at it at this moment about one point three point four points uh uh it's after the weekend then it's interesting to look at the league table and not uh after the game we've played seen two players having a big impact for you at the at the moment at very different stages of their career Ryan grenberg 22 what do you make of the progress that he's made this season and then also we've seen moella and the numbers that he's producing once again what enables him to keep producing those kind of numbers at the age or what do you see in him that allows him to do that at the age of 32 I think it why players play well has has first of all to do with the quality they have as a players so so um am MOA has a lot of quality Ryan has a lot of quality actually every player that plays here has a lot of quality now it's up to us and I say us because not only me my staff it's also the players to play in the best possible way as a team and then individuals will do special things so um it was an unbelievable finish from Mo but the only reason he got the chance to finish was because Trent Alexander arold made an overlapping run and that's why it opened up on the inside and yeah if you give that space to Mo then he can do then he can score a special goal so again that's about his quality it's about Ryan's quality but the amount of time feril Oru plays balls through uh to Ryan where Ryan can turn and then he can play his balls towards all the all the good attackers we have that makes it in my opinion a team of four performance which is which is really well and then yeah as a result of that you see individuals playing good also I'm sorry to ask again hopefully you understand that I have to ask just to check in case there is something you can exactly because there has been that more speculation about Trent this week I just wonder what can you tell us this week if anything about Trent Mo's Virgil's contract situation any possible developments around that uh I was hoping that you didn't in your last question didn't use the word contracts because then I was saying yeah Trent is doing like this and he's doing like this uh it's yeah it's the same boring answer as always um and I could I could really understand if you ask me this once every two weeks but if you ask me this after two or three days again then you still get the same answer and people feel that I'm boring them we got International break okay okay so try it after the international break again morning Anna um just just on on Ryan he's up for the Premier League player of the month um as you mentioned there is only 22 or just wonder how much further he can go in terms of his development how much more he can improve now that if if you look at all the signings we've made at this club for in the past I don't know how many years most players were underneath 24 25 and and there's I think also reason for this because you expect players from 22 or 23 especially if if they come to a to a club like Liverpool in this environment and in the way they've worked here that you expect progress more than you expected maybe or probably from a player that's 33 or 34 so um then it is not that big of a surprise if you bring the qualities like Ryan Graber in that if you start to work with him you do the right program and has the uh the teammates that he has that he can progress and that's what we are seeing at the moment now it's up to him to keep the standards as they are at this moment and uh that's a challenge because him he like all the others have to play every 3 days and um and that that is also a challenge for all of us but also for him because he hasn't played a lot of games last season I think now he already played more 90minut games than he did in the past two seasons so interesting to see how he copes with it but till now he does really well just on on Palace had a bit of a struggle so far but they have finished top 10 last season um are you surprised at the way they've started how big a challenge will they be I've said many times when it comes to us and I said it also in relation to wolves last last week that if you play six games it's so hard to judge the league table um the the the the weird thing or maybe that's uh that's not weird but but they cut some results against United and and against Chelsea two top teams so the other results were not uh as as they would have probably wanted it last season they finished really strong uh lost one or two good players that that's also clear but um I said about wolves last week and I can think I can say the same about this team that they will do better during the season hopefully not tomorrow of course with the international break coming up obviously your only defeat of the Season came straight after the last one are you a bit concerned about how much your players are playing at the moment do you feel that some of them might need their minutes managed while they are away with their national teams no the first thing I look at is tomorrow and uh and then we will wait and see if again we are the team where where I think last time you guys told me that we had 10 players playing all the minutes uh and the next one was five uh I don't know if it's true but that's what you guys told me uh so I have to assume it's true because journalists always speak the truth don't they yeah in England they do um um so I don't look forward yet towards the games that are coming after the international break but the the difference between this internal break and the last one is that this time we play a late kickoff it's Sunday and last time we played it Saturday so it gives us one extra day of rest which is always helpful especially for the ones that come back with a jet lag from from South America you said on Wednesday that you didn't create a lot of chances for Darwin Nunes is it a case of he needs to work a little bit harder to adapt to your style or maybe do you need to sort of look at his needs and the way he plays and maybe adapt to him a little bit more it's both it's both I think it's it's the challenge we as a staff always have to bring the best out of the individuals so we try to uh find different ways of positioning Darwin than Joo because they are not the same players so their teammates also adjust to um to the player they are playing with uh and that's also what I as a manager have to do and also what we are doing yes he didn't score in his last game uh because he was offside as well so when we bring him the chances he's able to score but unfortunately we couldn't bring him that much in the position we want to if if if I'm completely honest which I like to be just as your journalist um even Joo didn't had I think the most goals we scored come from our Wingers till now and Joo scored two when we played West Ham and then he played from the 10 position so maybe it's it's also for us something to look at although we score a lot of goals to bring our Striker if it's Joo even more in in positions to score being top of the table are you wary about people getting carried away with the St Club has made no we're at Liverpool so players are here used to be on top of the table so it would be uh would be very weird if a player at Liverpool then is all of a sudden uh with his head in the clouds is that also something you say okay uh so no that's um but if if we don't play well tomorrow people will probably come up with that instead of saying that P did well or we maybe did other things wrong but um I don't see this and that would definitely not be normal for two reasons these players are experienced enough to understand the league table after six games as well and the schedule we had compared to some other teams second of all uh feril Ali Trent uh Robo um they won the league here here Mo they won the league here they won the Champions League here so for them it's it's a nice thing to be on top of the table but uh I'm not expecting them to watch their mobile every second of the day seeing them uh being top of the table no first of all it was me who came up with the stat about players in the special break I can confirm it was definitely true you mentioned earlier about the 12:30 kickoffs after played on a Wednesday now uh the lunchtime kickoffs have been quite debate for Liverpool quite some years but one thing that's not often mentioned is how often Liverpool playing away from home another step for you since 20171 18 this will be the 40th 123 kickoff and 30 of those have been away from home now currently premier league rules around playing lunchtime after in Europe only kind of govern uh playing away in the European game are you surprised that playing away in the subsequent League game isn't brought into consideration uh in general I think uh the league where I'm coming from in Holland we uh uh there they are more aware and they try to help the teams that in play in Europe more uh than it happens over here but to be fair to the to the English FA our schedule here is so tight that it's so so difficult and uh I think uh it's also something that has to do with the people are sitting in front of me so for television stations I I have the feeling I do an interview every day so um uh that that that is why we think I play a 12:30 because I think they can pick which team they want to have on 12:30 yeah and then it's nine out of 10 times Liverpool is included I don't think it has so much to do with the 1230 kickoff for me it has to do that every away game is difficult so I I I showed them last week that 10 out of 18 uh away games last season didn't lead to a win so you can then argue if it's 12:30 or or is it just difficult to play in a away game and and we can come up with new cars and Forest and there were two others where there were last second uh winners so that shows you how difficult it is to play in away game uh especially For Us in um in this league and yeah because we play so many times and at 12:30 people talk about 12:30 I think we have to talk about an away game that that is difficult because if 1230 was a difficult time to perform then I was I'm a really stupid manager because we train every day at 12:00 so um so yeah I don't see the idea behind it being that difficult uh performing at that time about fed he getting on going to be available for weekend wait and see he didn't train for the last two days he came in today uh to see if he could train and if he can I still have a decision to make because uh we can only select 20 and he hasn't trained for a few days so um but first of all we have to wait and see if he can even train and if he can then it's then it's my decision our decision if we bring him to the game or not
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,aze7DQ8wLWs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aze7DQ8wLWs,[Music] first of all uh how's Allison is he ready to return where is he in his recovery uh we think he is uh he um he trained yesterday a part of our session with the group so we expect him to do the whole session today so we think he's available but of course we have to train today um and of course we're really happy with with Ellison being back but I want to emphasize on the fact that qu did really well in the two games he he was on goal for us so uh another example of me having uh two and I think even three good options uh in certain position in this uh in go whereas in your forward line you got six options just thinking jot scored two goals against West Ham uh salah's got four goals in his seven games so far gak Po's Off the Mark with two against West Ham nunz started back toback games and scored against Bournemouth and L Diaz five goals in six appearances so far add to that you've been able to give k a minute so talk us through how you how you look at or how would you describe the decisions you've got to make When selecting your starting forward line for me it says two things it says one that these players have a lot of quality uh and second of all it says that the team is always creating chances for the players that we are uh selecting for that game uh because if we if we play uh Cody or if we play Lucho the team is just creating chances for these individuals and because they have so much quality they can make this uh promote this to assists or goals so um yeah that's what it says to me also it's just I need to follow up on that just because it's showing that they're they're sharp as well whether they've been out of the side they're coming in and producing how are you able to maintain that sharpness when they're not necessarily getting you know the maximum amount of minute yeah that's the positive thing about playing so many games that these players will always play a lot of games um and I think they understand that they can't play every game uh unless it's absolutely necessary um to keep them fit and sharp and to keep them ready to perform like they do uh so um as long as um as they accept the situation as it is and that's what they're doing at the moment because they have they can they have good numbers and I see them smile a lot as well then it's a very positive thing for us and that's also one of my things on my job uh I have to keep them alert and um and happy in the position they are in finally Premier I think I know the answer to this as well but with regards to contract situations obviously there's further talk of trump being offered a new contract continues to be linked with Real Madrid how disappointed would you be if you only got to work with Trent Andor Virgil or Mo for just one year because I'm guessing you're not going to bring us up to date on what the contract situation is at the moment no no and you're just trying to to uh find another way of asking me uh I'm very happy that these three players are in my team at the moment and there are a lot of games to be played in this season and especially also in the upcoming uh week and weeks so I'm really happy that uh that I can select them um and let's see what the future brings continuing on with that theme of the day of the squad Curtis James obviously impressing in midweek as well particularly after the change of position when it's so necessary in this busy period that you've already spoken about how impressed are you with this inheritance squad's willingness to learn adapt on the job on the go I think I've said it on many occasions already that I'm really happy with the squad I inherited not only because of their quality but maybe even more about the culture that you're going left behind so all these players are team players so they accept their role even if they are not playing uh and they always want to work hard for the team first and um yeah it's um it's it's been a it's been a privilege to uh inherit a a squad like I inherited from you wolves obviously the opposition struggling to get off the mark this season just one point from their five games what do you expect from them this weekend I don't think it's a it's um um it represents or it present the way they played um and they had a very tough fixtion list uh in the first five games I think they played Arsenal away Newcastle away filla away Chelsea at home so yeah that's that's more difficult schedule than we had for example so you always have to take this in into account and I of course I had to watch a few games of them because we play them tomorrow and I can see that even the games were very tight they deserved more than they got a few times so I think they will be fine during the season hopefully not tomorrow but they will be fine uh in the end of the season hi there honor um more encouraging signs this week with the victories against Bournemouth and West Ham but in both games you gave up quite a lot of chances towards to the opposition how much of a concern is that because excellent goalkeeping from Quin K in both games but you can't always guarantee that goalkeeping Excellence even despite the fact you've got you know quality in that position yeah now the last thing you say is is very important uh for us in the last two games that we have a lot of quality in that position uh on the other hand we create a lot a lot a lot of chances as well but in an Ideal World we don't conceit as much as we did in the last two games but if there was one big difference for me between my former Club and the competition I worked in and this competition is that every team has so many quality players uh in their squad and in their team that they're always able to to create chances as well um so you always you also have to give credit to the teams we face and the quality they are having but uh we need to do better uh in that aspect if we want to keep clean sheets more and more often so um we keep emphasizing on that one of the reasons why the other team doesn't score that easy it's also because we have a good goalkeeper but if you every time count the bodies that are inside our 18 Yard Box the moment the other team gets a chance that's also real positive thing and it makes it more difficult for the other team to score as well well how do you address the question of doing better defensively because there's clearly a a risk and reward element to the way that you plays is it tinkering with what the players do individually and so therefore collectively no was mostly about working on it collectively but in the last game I think a few chances also came from set pieces one the goal they scored also came from a set piece and their second big chance in the game was also a set piece then we lost one time the ball so easy where SFI could go on a One V one so um um but as as always it's always about uh the collective idea that is what we have to improve and um then the individual quality that we have helps of course to uh to to become better as a team as well thank you H I was interested to read in your program notes midweek that you kind of challenging the players to show you how they react to certain situations interested to know maybe if there's anything particular that you've learned in the last week or so that maybe you weren't aware of before or anything that stood out in particular I've said it earlier I learned day by day uh uh every time more about the players because um of course you know their quality you know what they can do on the training grounds but um we we haven't faced many setbacks yet although the um Forest game was a setback for us so you always want to learn how do individual players and we as a team react on on setbacks how do we react if we play a fantastic game uh with a great score how do we react three days later so you you have to learn day by day um and um and that's what what I'm doing and then you try to adjust where wherever you can to trigger them to get the best out of themselves because um it's all about offense defense and all these things we try to work on but it's also every time you try to find a trigger for them to be on top of their game every single time they step out on the pitch I know you've spoken generally about the the depths of the forward line can I ask you about Lis Diaz five goals this season already um I think that's probably an area that's improved for him personally since last season where he was maybe getting in the positions but not not not getting the goals what what's change with him do you think well that's difficult for me to judge because I wasn't here of course last season um it's still a small sample size where we are talking about and um and uh I said before also when it comes to us uh winning quite a lot of games that till now we've faced almost all the team we faced are on the bottom League of the tables the way you say it where of course we expect United to be uh on top of the table in the end of the maybe not on top but in the top of the table in the end of the season so um there's still a lot for us to prove maybe the fixure list helped us by this amount of goals the forward scores uh and let's see if we can keep scoring so many goals if the fix list is getting harder and harder starting tomorrow in a difficult away game against wolves have you done anything specific with him in terms of you know improving his output for goals no I don't think so not particularly with him yeah we train on a daily basis trying to get them as most as we can in certain situations and then help them in the best possible way where to position themselves and and and how to um uh what to do in certain situations but it's it's mainly also in this last word of the pitch the quality of the player and the finishing he has and I think he always had this um and I wasn't even dead aware of the fact that how many did you score last season eight eight okay okay for me he was someone who could score a goal and eight is for his quality not of his standards I would say but did he play a lot did he play over again yeah yeah okay so uh then then I think it he just comes back to his normal uh situation maybe was a bit unlucky last season but a player of his quality will always score a lot of goals in every season Anor one of the Hallmarks of all season so far they've been starting very quickly in games so I think they've been ahead at halim in both of their last two games even though they went on to lose those and the same happened when Liverpool went there last season and then if you look at Liverpool's last few games you obviously you had the goal away in Milan but there was a couple of early moments against Bournemouth and against West Ham where maybe concentration wasn't at its highest what do you put that down to and is there something you've stressed ahead of this challenge against wolves if you look at us our games I think it's always in a game the first 15 to 20 minutes both teams have a lot of energy and they're all very hard and try to get uh uh maximum energy in the start and then after 10 15 20 minutes the game mostly settles down and then the team that in my opinion plays the best football gets the ball a lot and starts to play but the first 15 to 20 are always two teams that are uh doing this when it comes to wolves I'm not surprised that they go up because they play really good football and I think they've been really unlucky not getting the results they might have deserved and um even last season because that game where Li won they were also one nil up and I think it took to the 85th minute where where Robo scored uh a goal which he doesn't do a lot but uh so that was also a a tough game for us so I think the players who played that game and almost all of them are still in the team know how tough it is to play over there so uh we need to be ready from in the start but that that you need to be in every game because like I said in the beginning it's always uh two teams full of energy trying to come out in the best possible way last Anna um how do you feel you came in and start of the season after the Jag and how do you are you pleased with the progress of the team so far where you are in the table you know did you expect to be this high up especially with the fixture lists that came out and you know can plays keep this going for the entire season I think it's been a positive start with with a small disappointment of us losing at home against nothing for us I think every every home game you lose is a disappointment especially if it's not against the team that's competing for uh for for for a top four position although you never know what nothing for is going to do this season but um that was definitely a disappointment but overall has been a good start not a perfect one cuz then we would have won we should have won um the game where was just referring to but the style we play the way we play uh is is is still very close I think to what you guys were used to for nine years and uh which is quite normal because we almost have all the same players like Yan had and um keeping results going is a good thing again uh I have to mention about that the fixtion list has been good to us although you never know maybe in 17 or 18 games these team that are now on the bottom side of the will maybe maybe go up in the upcoming weeks or months so um it's been a good start but not a perfect one
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,bTsItqn3-b4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTsItqn3-b4,don't break out right all right good morning good to see you um your first League Cup TI as Liverpool manager there'll be lots of thirst won't throughout throughout the year where where does this one lie in your priorities for the football club it's very important because it's the next one the next game we play and that's always the most important one and um I know the history of this club I know what happened last year I know how special winning a cup can be so uh we are far away from that because it's the first game and lot have to be played and we have a difficult tie against West Ham fortunately at home but um it's a game to look forward to and an important one as always the next game is do you see this as a as a chance to utilize the squad I'm sure there are a lot of players wanting game time and you you probably wanting to give them game time yeah uh I want all of them to play unfortunately that's not possible uh because you can only name 11 but um we will play with the best possible team and um that can sometimes also mean that other players that have played a lot or maybe a bit more tired so that means because the differences are so small that I will select for this game a different players but um they will come in today and we will look at how fit they are and then I will make the decision who's going to start and who isn't is feder Rico ker pushing for a start and would you would you like to see him 19 minutes no I don't think he's able to play 90 minutes uh he only played 25 now as a maximum in the last three four or five months uh he didn't play I don't think he played any friendly as U as well so um but he's he's able to start in our opinion and if he will yeah let's see um there are many options we have uh but um he's able to start in our opinion but I don't think he's able to play 90 at the level we are playing uh tomorrow against a strong West Ham team I know kaher has been the the goalkeeper in this competition in the main for the for the last few seasons um how is Allison in terms of his Fitness um it's uh it's sure if it's sure that uh que will be in goal tomorrow um Addison is is getting there but I think this game is is coming just a bit too early and we are um we're looking at the at the weekend against wolves but it's going to be tight so let's see if he manages to be there but he will not be there tomorrow so qu will be in goal tomorrow that's the one thing I know for sure at this moment just as holders of the trophy does that make it different to you feel um I know fans love winning trophies Liverpool keep on winning this trophy yeah not only fans love winning trophies players do and managers do as well so uh we all love to win something but that's far away we have to play our first game uh of this tournament tomorrow and um and like I said it's a tough one with West Ham United at home but um but yeah it's always nice to win something and I know the his in the history of the club they won it a lot a lot of times and recently last season in a spe in a very special way with so many youngsters on the pitch in the final so uh I think if you've won it last season it uh it gives a it gives a bit of um how should I say this in English uh we are aware of the fact that we won a last season so that we are the the the holders of the of the trophy so we have to uh um protect that is that the right word to use maybe not perfect but uh we're going to give everything to to uh to win it again let's put that just finally for me a word on on West Ham their start of the season has not been what they would have wanted really how how do you see uh how do you see them in terms of coming to onfield yeah tough start as well they faced some uh some strong opponents um and I saw during their games that they have very good spells as well uh sometimes were a bit unlucky with the results lot of good players uh brought in a lot a lot of players uh in the in the summer window that that haven't been implemented yet but maybe there's a chance for them tomorrow to start um so they will they will come back back stronger because of all the quality they already had last season and which they brought in we have a good manager as well so hopefully it it's going to take them a few days extra but uh they will um they will come back stronger than they first started the season hi honor um how important is it to get that Rhythm into the players who haven't played as many minutes this season and how excited are you to see them playing some competitive football from the start they they have the ones that haven't played a lot here at Liverpool uh have played their games uh for their for the countries um but it's important for them to to keep getting playing time and it's very very difficult to arrange some friendlies for them because of our schedule so that's why we've rotated already a bit in the last few games where you saw um other players coming in apart from the ones that all started in the first two or three games and this might be a chance for other players to uh to get some playing time as well but it's not only only about playing style playing time it's also for them uh if they do really well during the week which they've all done till now they will get their chance eventually that's also what you saw with Darwin and um and with Cody as well so let's see who will get the chance tomorrow but but but most of them maybe all of maybe even all of them will get their playing time during the season we've seen how well Cody G played against as Bland and dar Nunes scored on Saturday as well all those players on who haven't been playing as much must be really hungry to get that game time as well yeah yeah but I think every player is hungry to get playing time if you play every week you're hungry to stay in the team uh there's so much competition in this team we've got so many good players that and and I think they also like to go out uh because they like uh they like to play they play for a great Club in front of great supporters so uh we would not like uh to play uh at a club like this in a home game for tomorrow as well so uh um we're in a good place when it comes to the Quality players we have and uh I can um I can choose between a lot of players for tomorrow again as well thank you on a Trent said after Bournemouth that he's finding his relationship with you really refreshing and and he's loving how harsh you are with him to try and push him to become one of the best defenders in Europe what do you think that says about where he his career at the moment that he's he's seeking that you know from you in that way um it's nice to hear it and to read it uh because I think we all uh remember uh the day yugan left what that meant to him uh so you can assume then how good of a relationship the two had and to hear him saying this after two or three months about his new manager is always nice apart from um all other things but it's it's always it's it's always good that if they had such a strong relationship and a lot of them maybe all of them had that with Juran it's not always easy to come in and to replace a manager like this and that that he feels it like this is a positive thing I think um but it's the same with him as with all the others um they all get a lot of individual attent attention uh to try to make them better because if they will get better then the team will get better as well he also said defens is championships and we spoken the last week or so about how it's five sheets in six4 you now just interested to know whether actually how well the defense has been going has made your job simpler higher up the pitch I appreciate it's all connected has that maybe allowed you to make more progress than maybe you thought you might because the defense has been so good yeah defense has been really good although in our last game I think we needed a goalkeeper too many times uh to keep the clean sheet um and uh I think it was yesterday or the day before I looked at the league table and looked at okay which teams did we Face till now and in what position are they or the left side of the table and the right side of the table and I think all of them apart from United or I'm not sure about United but but most of them are on the right side of the table so um we say the right side of the table is it all the way you say it over yeah okay okay um we go left and right but you go just one okay uh um so you have to take that in account as well there are a lot of difficult teams we still have to face and um if we were able uh after playing those teams as well with' now apart from West Ham United tomorrow we go uh in the league for two difficult away games let's see where we are then when it comes to conceding goals because uh maybe the fixing schedule has been nice to us when you look at the league table and we've played from the five games we play three times at home so that helps as well talking about the relation has be used about how much work defensive side in previous defensive side I just wanted talk about what you've been doing with him because he's always been seen as this attacking right back who was more creative and and the defensive side is G something that for Grant being to be what have you done what have you seen this game that needs work yeah it's difficult for me to judge how it has been uh uh in the years before the only thing I know is that we are talking here about a player that won the Champions League and won the league title so uh and and he mentioned himself Trent that winning a league uh is about defending so it's uh it's clear to me then that he's been a good Defender all his life but because he's so so special with the ball the main emphasis goes to uh him doing special things with the ball and um I think with him it's not about is if he's capable of of of of doing things it's more his concentration rate constantly be be be on in a 100% Focus it's where it's more about with him so this is where we talk about a lot that he has to stay active in every situation of the game even if the ball is further away from him uh um but it's not that we or I learned him to defend in the last three months he's won the league he's won the Champions League uh so um it's just getting him to understand what what all is necessary to play um to play the best possible game and that's that's what that's what we talk about with all the individuals but also with him M uh the under 21's play tonight the competition will trade only be in that squad or is he do you have in in mind for for the West Ham uh let's see first uh how everybody comes in to this morning and then we make a plan for every individual uh where he's going to play uh and if they are going to play um but the way I look at it now would be a fair chance for him to be in our Squad instead of um being with the under 21s but it also depends on how fit all the other players are what you made of him because there's bit of excitement about player with a lot of talent what what's your first impressions on him yeah I think what you say is true he's a young player a young young player really young only just became 17 but with a lot of talent that uh had some impact in preseason so then uh and um and when he when he played against ailia even scored a goal so uh a talent but um only being a talent is not enough not enough to to play regular on a regular basis in the first game so we need to keep developing him he needs playing time he needs playing time to develop and that's why sometimes as a manager you feel like oh we might need him with the first team but it's so so important for him to keep playing his games that's why he played in Milan also with the under 19s um because for him to develop he needs to train with us and and he needs to keep having his playing time at the highest possible level but I think um play training with the likes of all the midfielders we have and all the players we have helps him to develop as well so we're taking good care of him and we are aware of the fact that he's only 17 just became 17 and that's probably also the reason why people see him as such a talent because he al already showed some uh some interesting things on this age an I wanted to ask you about Ibrahim mate's performance against bour in particular his use of the ball it appeared the way the Bournemouth were playing it seemed as though they saw as an apparent weakness they were marking bandik very heavily every time Keller had the ball so canate was often the spare man and he had the task of trying to make a lot of key decisions in the buildup and yet his passes were instrumental with all three goals so as a coach when an opponent sees something as the apparent weakness how pleasing is for you to see it to become a strength I'm not sure if if they see him as a weakness uh what could be is that they s see Virgil as an unbelievable strength uh so that makes it maybe for IBU it's not that he has a weakness but maybe fil is even further ahead when it comes to uh bringing the ball out from the back uh it was a surprise for us as well because all the games they played till now they were pressing the left Center back with their number 10 and this was the first time they went to the right and for us it was a real good decision for the reason you just said because it l to three goals but who knows what would have happened if they uh given fil the same uh amount of space Maybe we SC would have scored even more uh but it's a very positive thing for us and for me to see that um that if if if they think they can press IBU that uh IBU is capable of finding his teammates the way he did uh lot of today just word on ker because obviously we've spoke before about he Poss might have gone to somebody state but he was very switched on when you needed him on on S it must be very pleasing that you know when you can turn to me be 100% for you yeah yeah I wasn't surprised at all because of because of his performance because he uh he was very good in preseason already and I think he was very good with the with his national team as well so it's a good thing for us that we have two quality players and and and we forget the third one in his position because almost in every position we have two but in goalkeepers we have we've got three or four uh and our third one is also a real good goalkeeper so it's a good thing for us uh and like you saw we need to have a a strong Squad uh because you can pick up injuries or uh whatever what can happen so it was good to see and pleasing to see that he kept a clean sheet not in a way that he had nothing to do but uh he had to act a few times and he acted really well hold on yeah just on just one more on leis Diaz view he seems so highly motivated or something at the moment is it have you done anything differently with him and the way I looked at Liverpool for the last eight nine years I only saw players that were highly highly highly motivated I think almost every manager took Liverpool uh as an example of how to work without the ball so the energy they've put in in all these years with Jan I think that's what you still see and I'm really happy with this um so for me I don't see any change if you see it differently that's possible because you saw more games than me but the way I looked at all the Liverpool players and the way they've played here in recent years that they were all always very aggressive and that's what he still is yeah you're welcome
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,avs4qOZYdJ4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avs4qOZYdJ4,B asking me about his yeah yeah uh there were 12 moments where we scored three 12 minutes where we scored three goals but I think during the whole first half we saw many of those moments uh unfortunately for us the first and the second and the third didn't go in uh the good thing for us was their first chance didn't go in as well uh and then there was this 12 minutes of um of one attack after another that that to three goals uh which was really pleasing to see at that moment which we also needed because we played against a a tough opponent aent where which um which showed today that even when they were three- nil down they just kept on going kept on going kept on going so um was tougher than the result might have looked like C you hi I just wanted to talk about the the two Louis Diaz goals could you give us your verdict on them finishes in particular the finishes in both situations were really good but I think the the the the letup to both goals were different and that's why really good so in the first one in the first goal IU recognized really well that um that they had a high last line and they wanted to press us really high completely different than nothing on Forest and he recognized the right moment to play the ball in behind and in the second one we needed uh to play Mo and and and Trent reacted fantastically by coming underneath bounce pass Mo and he just went all the way with the ball all over the pitch and um and assisted to Lucho so both both team goals with different setups now that you're six games in how do you see your team compared to where you want to be yeah I set them to today in the in the in the pre-match meeting that I learn uh from them day by day and I that I was really curious to see how we would how we would react uh after the Milan game because what I know from the start and what I knew before I even start is that there's a lot of quality in this team that's that's that's clear but we're not the only one there are a lot of quality teams in this league but um so winning games is not so difficult if you have so much quality if you want to win more than only a few games it's also about mentality and uh after the United game which was a big win or a statement win I think you call it here in England um then uh to see us coming back against nothing on Forest like that that was not what you expect from a team that wants to compete for something so after the statement win or the big win against a Milan I was curious to see how he would react today and there was a much much better reaction than we had against naan Forest well you prefer to play against the low BL it not a bit more fun today you know a bit more open see to enjoy themselves a bit more yeah n it's both ways around because I think um um the one we lost notam forest they were only two times in front of our goal and the goal they scored was that a chance a shot from 20 yards this team today B have created much more chances against us than nothingham Force did on the other hand we created much more than we did against nothing on Forest so if you if you face a low block normally you don't conceed a lot of chances and I expect the longer we work together if we play against the low block that we can create much more so it's a bit weird that we didn't concede today and we did concede against nothingham Forest because looking at the chance creation today the other team created much more than nothingham Forest did all performance flag performance yeah no that's that's that's what what I noticed as well and that's um of course I play a striker because I like him to score goals I play a Winger because I like them to assist or to score goals because if you want to win a game you need to score goals but um it also helps if you keep a clean sheet and we just spoke about uh the lead up to both goals um IU was was involved in this but keeping a clean sheet Darwin is also involved in this because of the reasons you just told me so first and foremost they have to re work really hard for the team and then in the beginning of the Season it was Mo who made the difference with Lucho then it was Cody and uh and um and Joo who's been involved in goals and today it was Lucho and Darwin so that's all we want to see just yeah but not only two good goalkeepers also two good Wingers left Wingers two good right Wingers two good Strikers and that's what you saw today I just said about Cody how good he was in sanero how good luo was now and it's the same with the goalkeepers we needed our goalkeeper today more than in all the other matches we played before um because like I just said balov got more chances than I'm used to see the other team getting uh against us in the first six games of the season but it was a good thing that we had queef today uh because he made some really good saves which Allison did in the other games as well but he didn't have to make that many as gri had to make today just another one his problem's always been consistency so how do you help him yourself build this performance and Achi more consistency I think consistency uh uh you get by two things you get by work rate and you get it uh by uh by team performance and um if the team performance is not consistent it's so difficult for an individual to be consistent as well um so we just have to create our habits day by day on the training ground and in the games to get this consistency because while working on your habits you create consistency and um that's what what we try to do every day uh and um and yeah he showed today a good game and um maybe he can show Wednesday again but let's wait and see very last one Chris my first instinct was when he shot I said why does he shoot I was say why why don't you keep on dribbling because he he made the ball free and I think the defender was on the ground but then it was a fraction of a second later when I saw the ball went in of the post I was like okay maybe you are a better football player than I was in the past so uh good choice of him
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,rMkeX3_GrWc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMkeX3_GrWc,morning good morning good to see you how are you all good all good all good all good um 4:30 Sunday is a very big moment I guess for you your anfield career as Liverpool manager begins um just wonder how much you're looking forward to it and what you're expecting it's not going to be the first taste because we played sevilia already but uh it's clear that it's the first uh League game at Enfield and um looking forward to it but I'm looking forward to every game uh I've played in the past as a manager and also to to this one yeah it's going to be a big crowd probably twice as big as the one you played in front off last Saturday um how how do you manage the nerves are you are you a nervous manager I hope they are twice as loud as the iwit crowds because the iwit crowd was really really really loud so um I'm hoping the fans can be twice as loud than as the ipswitch ones that would be a big help for us but no I'm not nervous at all certainly not at this moment because I'm in the middle of prepar ation uh prepare the team for Sunday and actually um no nerves are not there not even at 425 on Sunday no no no no it wouldn't be a good a good thing if you've got nerves then probably you don't trust what you did before you just don't trust your team and um I trust what we as a staff do during the whole week to prepare the team in the best possible way and I trust the team a lot as well again on Sunday I know you've been asking recent weeks about new signings and and obviously you've been reluctant to to talk about them um mad ashilly is is that a deal that's that's done or very close to being done I think you know already the answer so um if if a deal is done then you will hear from us until that moment we don't speak about uh transfers or players that are not ours you don't seem worried at all by any lack of activity no because I trust the team and um I've said many times before I inherited a real good team a team of many young players as well and I think think we all know that especially young players can develop at at the ages they are on at the moment so we just try to work as hard as we can with them and we trust them a lot and they've they've they've proven last week that they earned this trust and I'm hoping that they show the same on Sunday again good luck enjoy the day thank you I will um just going on from from that theme there was such a a difference in terms of the first half performance versus the second half performance how do you feel uh you are getting on in terms of being able to explain to the players what it is you want from them and then then buying into that I think we're we're on a good track if that if that's the way to say it so um but we have to understand that some of them are only here for three weeks uh and there's quite a large part of our group is with us for three weeks so um and it's not only about us it's also about the opponent what they bring into the game and I think um I said it before that I switch put a lot a lot a lot of of energy in the first half to make it really difficult for us and um or we stepped up or I was were not able to keep bringing the same energy in the second half and um I think it was a bit of both and uh we got a bit more space and then you can see how well these boys can play but um there's still a lot a lot of work to do but uh it's it was a good first uh First Step especially the second half um and in making substitutions at half time when you look at the quality of the bench that you've got it must be great to see that those options that you have but in in making sure that you are not afraid to make substitutions are you partly learning more about the squad that you have but also trying to create some competition oh I'm learning every day still of about these players about the individuals and also how they cooperate with each other so um and um for me the last week was not only important on Saturday the Sunday was also really important because I learned and saw there that the ones that didn't play on Saturday were able to bring a really good training session in on Sunday and I think that is one of the mo not one of the most that's a really important thing for a team as well because we all know that we're going to need many many many of them during the season for a lot of game minutes and um they brought in a really good training session on Sunday and um that that will help them and us for the the rest of the season and yes I am still learning new things about the players which is normal because like I just said with some of them I only work for three weeks so uh still seeing new things from them h house Joe Gomez do you feel like his head's in the right place for this weekend yeah he's been in the right place for three weeks so uh he's worked really really hard since he came back but uh he um he didn't play a lot the Euros when he came back and in the first sessions we couldn't um he couldn't train the whole session so we had to manage his load a bit and that was also the reason why he wasn't in the team last Sunday but this week he had a good week so u in terms of uh load uh how much he could do with the team so um yeah he's one of the players that I see new things from and and and and and learn things what I see from him also combined with other players so uh it's been a good week for him and for us still not and the club have done some notable business with brenford this window just wondering how much admiration you have for their model and how they go about things on the pitch as well for brenford J me um I think they they they brought into really talented and good players uh and then you could ask yourself the question why do they leave now the both of them have played a lot a lot a lot of minutes last season and I think the both of them wanted to continue Contin that journey of playing time and um I think they were able to play for us but there were there so much competition in the positions they played that they wouldn't play every minute of every single game and um then it was a good deal it's a real good deal for us and I think it's a good deal for brenford and it's also a good deal for the players so um everybody happy unless they uh they do too well on Sunday do you admire the way brenford play as well as yeah yeah yeah you can see that their manager is there for a long time already they uh in the last game against Crystal Palace they could play a 442 and could play a 532 so they can change systems within a game and I I think that's hardly impossible if you work with a group for three four or five weeks let alone maybe even after a year it's still not possible because it's so difficult to to bring the best out of them in one system so if you can play two systems with them yeah you have to uh make the conclusion that Thomas Frank is doing a real good job over there for for a lot of years already and um and they played a real good first game as well as well as a good preseason so it's going to be um a challenge for us on Sunday again to play them how has Gerald k Quanza reacted since being taken off at halim against ITP switch in a way you would expect the player to react so I spoke to him immediately after the game uh spoke to him the day after on Sunday and in the end of that conversation he asked if he could train uh Sunday so normally he should have done recovery he wanted to train and um unfortunately I think it was Tuesday that he picked up a bit of an injury so he couldn't train on Wednesday and let's see if he can train today but he reacted in a in a way every player should react but I don't think there was that much into it although uh maybe the language was a problem because what I said was he did not lose every Jewel but he lost one or two important ones and one of them was just before halftime um and from what's been told to me it's like that I've said that he lost every Jewel which he did he he did not do we as a team lost too many jewels and he he lost one or two as well and this is also what I said to the team the day after that it was not about Gerel that we as a team didn't do well but in my opinion the only threat at that moment from is was the lab and he won one or two important jewels and I was trying to get that strength out of their team by bringing in IBU and Sh a couple of younger players this transfer window some fans might be concerned that you might be letting some promising Talent go a little too soon do you understand where they're coming from yeah that's always a difficult one because young players want to play as well and if they want to develop they have to play and it's always like this so they come through the ranks of the Youth Academy and either than you're good enough to play for us many minutes or you're still not there or there's too much competition in your position and uh I think still this team which what we have have a lot of uh homegrown players and um and and one of them trainer only is also training with us on a daily basis but only 17 yet so uh this club will always bring good youngsters and uh it's it's always a challenge to find the right moment either to play them or if they've played quite a lot of minutes they want to make the next step in their career and if that is not possible because Virgil V is playing here or Moos Salah is playing here or all the other top players are playing here then it's the best for them and also for the club to let them go um because uh you always want to take care of your own interest but you also have responsibility to do the players and if they want to play somewhere and it's not possible for us with us and they're not happy with five or 600 minutes because these youngsters didn't play much Premier League games they played a few games in the cup then um then you have to um in my opinion let them develop somewhere else thank you on Center situation is it a case of three players competing for one place alongside Vil or do you see different players coming in like like different jobs to do um f came in three weeks ago and uh in my opinion he made a lot of impact uh when he came back so he made a lot of impacts in all these years he's played here but me working with him he's shown how much he cares about the team and how how how good he is um but for him it's and the same with Mo like all the others they still have to bring their performances in uh so in my opinion there are four players uh having competition for two positions um but at this moment it's clear that fil is playing and he's also going to play on Sunday if he's fit um you you selected grber as the six guess probably not position he play greatly throughout his career what do you see as his qualities for that role for your team I think um he brings in certain qualities which we like in that position but he only played uh uh two games in that position and he did it in both times really well so against United he played well oh three games though against sevilia and against zwitch now only one of them was um was a game that matters uh in terms of a Premier League game so he has a lot to prove on that position still but uh first first games he did well but like with all of them it's not about the individual it's always what the team around them do for him uh and um what he has is he has running capacity so he can keep on running he has a knigh height and he's really comfortable with the ball so he has some attributes that he could play in that position but still a lot to prove for him as for all the others and um we have other options in that position as well so interesting uh competition in many positions yeah any more for the breakout please just on Joe gz can I check you is your understanding is you expect him to be here for this season you're not expecting any movement on that at this moment I'm expecting everyone to be here but like you know you are maybe even longer in football than I am looking at you you're a little bit older than me yeah uh so everything can change one thing I know short only is longer football than
Liverpool,Arne Slot,Press Conferences,UluDtbzVLs0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UluDtbzVLs0,hello Anna um what did you make of your first premier league game and um and a very good second half for you made a big change at uh we as a team made a big change at halftime because we came out totally different than we came out the first half but uh I have to give credits to IP switch as well because I think they were aggressive they were not afraid they were playing all over the pitch One V one to defend us and then it's about winning your jewels and winning your second balls and I think um they won more than us and that's why it was absolutely an equal game in the first half but second half we won more Jewels uh we won more second balls and we played more balls in behind because if the other team team take the risk of playing one31 and you have the likes of Lis Diaz Mo Salah and Joo jota then used them play the balls in behind that's what we did better the second half and from there on gaps opened up and you could see also how how good and well we could play in ball possession I mean most Sal Got This Record now n no one scored more goals in the opening met okay it's hard to think he's going to get out of contract at the end of the season he looks like he's to play another four or five years at this level I I if I see what he does to keep his body as it is and to be ready to play every every game I think there's there are many more years inside of him to play but uh if if you're okay with it I'm looking now at brenford and not at the end of of uh the season an you seem to suggesting your quotes to TV that you were unhappy with the uh the balls that your your team were losing in the first half were you were you quite forceful at half time in the message that you delivered to the players no not so much that we lose the balls too much I think we lost far too many juwels so uh they were uh very aggressive that also led to threee yellow cards um but in a good way aggressive so uh and uh we didn't cope with that well enough in my opinion so that's what I said to them at halim if you want to win over here you need to to go a step up in terms of winning your jewels first and and and and and make it a fight out of it instead of accepting that they every time we play a ball long that the ball ends up in our 16 again and um that was um it helped us I think as well that IU K came in because he uh from the start won his jewels from the number nine and that gave us all so um a lot of ball possession and and that led to two goals which we could have scored a few more though and there's been a lot of talk about the defensive Midfield position but I thought Ryan was excellent in there today I what did you make of him in that position today for me it's all always about the team so if an individual performance is really good that is because the team does really well so um Everybody uh is emphasizing on the goal Mo scored and the assist he had but both goal were from a buildup situation where we started one time with Virgil and the other time I think even with Allison so we need to make sure that these players the attackers come in in in promising positions and the team needs to help them for that and it's the same with Ryan if of course Ryan is attacking minded uh but if if we want if we play with him the rest of the team needs to help him as well so it takes a lot of effort for the for the for the attackers and for the attacking midfielders to help him there but what we do know with ran and that he can play the ball forward if he sees options to do so so that helped us today especially in the second half on a personal level what was your overall first impression of the the Premier League experience this week right up until arriving switch going through the G what was your first experience now when I started here there were many things that have been told to me but one of them was that Jan hated the 1230 kickoff and today the team showed that we hated the team uh the the 12:30 kickoff because we were not in the game in the first half and the second thing is what people told me is that there are no easy games in the Premier League and we sh that today if you play against a newly promoted team and they can make such a fight out of as they did in the first half they make can make it so difficult for us then there's probably a lot more to come and that's why it's also important for us to have weeks like the upcoming ones where we can work with the team to prepare them even better than we prepared them today because uh first half was not good enough second half was a real good performance last coup quick en toay defending we do with 11 we don't do this with one player um so he needs to have um we need to help him as all the others in in the position where he's playing in or where anyone else is playing in so it's not that only Virgil and IBU or only fil and Jerell are defending the whole team have to do so and if we defend with 11 and that would help Ryan or whoever is playing there a lot because um last season Maka played there a lot and I think he has certain qualities that Ryan has as well I think if you look at both players the first thing you think of is with the ball in ball possession and um that's why we as a team uh have to make sure that um whoever is playing in that position is not too exposed and um that's what happened today because I think the team really helped uh to defend in in in the best possible way and and because of that Ryan had a good performance last one here it's going to be a process for you to impose your your football on this team but it's wonder how close that impressive second half was to what you want to see seon yeah I don't think for the Liverpool support is the first time in nine years that they saw the team playing really well so uh I inherited a very very good team with a lot of great individuals but also these players have to understand that it's not enough what they brought in the first half and um if they bring the maximum of their Capac capacity then they can play really really good and that's what they showed in the second half uh today but um it was good to see that uh the goals we scored but I think the the attack that would probably be a match of the day tonight as well uh that didn't led to a goal was the nicest one and that was the one Lucho just hit over the bar that was a that was a way I want to see the team doing more and more and more and more if they can go in behind to Salah and even in the first half that seemed like a clear rout to goal was that something you worked on anything the way that the other team defends that that there we have to find our answer and today IPS took the risk to play One V one all over the pitch so their Center back always stepped in towards Dominic subers that means that you leave free Defenders against free Strikers three of our attackers and then we we need to recognize those moments and then make sure that we bring those free players in dangerous situations and that's then not to to to keep playing short then we have to find them with direct passes or passes in behind and that led to the fact that they didn't took that risk anymore and from that moment on we had a lot of time to play and to do our buildup which we saw the second half uh so uh in the end of the second half so we have to recognize how the other team is defending and then we have to find our answer and um that's what we did really well in the second half thank you
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,JVo2SNcIUBI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVo2SNcIUBI,hi Jason good morning um nice to speak to you you're filling in for Eddie How today how is the manager and will he be well enough to take charge of the team on Sunday he has been really poorly the last couple of days been bedridden uh but we've been been in daily contact we've been speaking probably three or four times a day so it's not affected any of the preparations uh up until now but you know we still got a couple of days and I'm sure he'll be fine for the weekend so you have you been leading training this week with the manager absent yes the last couple of days uh since he's been absent been been leading training uh with the other the other members of staff uh but as I say you know I think you know the manager should be back available for the weekend go back to Monday night and the victory that you had at Leicester City you've won both matches now since you returned to action following Wembley and then the break that you had how pleased have you been with the response of the players to get a big six points in those two matches yeah we've been really pleased uh obviously when you come off the back of such a high uh of winning the cup final then there's always that uh potential where you know you could lose your focus from from the league form that's so important for us so you know in some senses the cup final came at a good time we obviously won that and then we went into the international break so gave us that period to enjoy that moment but then to get some really good work into the guys and to make sure they was fully focused and prepared for you know for the first game after that which was Brenford uh and then away at Leicester and we've delivered to good performances not our best performances but you know the most important thing was you know getting the results and I think the lads uh you know deserve a lot of credit for that you've got eight matches remaining in your Premier League season and a game in hand on the teams around you how do you see that race for Europe because in the current standings it's really tight and there's a lot of teams that you are competing with for those places at the top it's really tight and as we know you know to try and get three points in the Premier League is incredibly difficult and you have to be at your best and you have to be at the top of your game because if you're not we know we've experienced that ourselves and you'll you'll get punished and as you say certainly with eight games to go uh everybody's fighting or a lot of teams fighting for for the same as what we are so you know all we can control is our own performances and what we do and I think the most important thing is that we go into every game we approach it as we have done all season uh and all we can do is go and give the best account of ourselves and deliver the performance that we expect of ourselves and hopefully that's good enough to get the three points and you know if we can continue that way then hopefully that'll be enough to achieve our end goal you've been without Anthony Gordon firstly through suspension and then he wasn't in the squad at Leicester on Monday how is he doing in his recovery from that knock that he picked up while on England duty and is he back for Sunday he's had a he's had a decent week with the physios he was back out on grass for a pitch session yesterday so we'll assess him again today to see how he's responded to that session uh and then we'll have to make a late call on whether he's available for the bench on Sunday and lastly what would you say about the magnitude of the fixture on Sunday because for a lot of fans Newcastle versus Manchester United is one of the biggest games that they will play as a rivalry that goes back a few decades you've come out on top against them at home in recent seasons and and your record is generally really good but it's obviously going to be a huge afternoon yeah it's you know we see it is a another important game for us uh I know you know no matter who Man United come up against is is a big game yeah uh huge football club with big expectations uh but we we prepare the same for Man United is how we did against Leicester so it's important that you know we we go into that game the lads know how important the game is with with only eight games remaining and the importance of every result so uh you know hopefully it's going to be a good game at St james Park and a game that we're hoping to do well in and to go and deliver the performance we know we can to to win the game thanks Razer keith H um what's the training ground like without Eddie the boss around the place yes it's as you as you know yourselves it's not very often that that he is not able to come to work and uh you know when the manager is not there obviously it's it's a bit different but it's only been a couple of days so you know and and we got such a great bunch of lads uh fantastic attitude and really good characters in there uh they know the expectations uh they know the demands um and they know what they need to deliver to you know to to make sure they're fully prepared for the weekend if you said a moment ago that you do expect him to be back come come Sunday but I think it was his first game that you you had to step in wasn't it against you've been in the in the hot seat at St james Park before if you had to yeah I'm not expecting uh him not to be available for Sunday you know I think if it was a game that was maybe tomorrow then potentially that might have been different but obviously we got the you know we got the game on Sunday um and I think the the extra day certainly will help him and I'm sure he'll be there to lead the team just um just looking at the the Arsenal result of course Real Madrid that means that there's there's five clubs Premier League clubs going to be in the Champions League um next season does that not give you guys a bit more comfort but does it kind of give you more hope if you like that you can be one of those teams that one of those places next season it's obviously it's obviously very tight there but when you look at this next week Manchester United on Sunday and then Crystal Palace if you win both of those you are in a you are looking like you're in a strong position yeah you know we've we're in a position that you know we want would have wanted to be in uh with eight games remaining competing for Champions League places and as you say uh with the Arsenal result the other night means there's an extra place five teams from the Premier League but then there's a lot of teams that are are fighting for for them positions so you know all we can focus on we know we've got a busy week coming up but the most important thing is that we just focus on the Man United game and making sure that we prepare right for that that's all we're in control of and you know I think if we can go and deliver a performance against Man United and get the result that we want uh you know it it takes us one step closer to to where we want to get to and how pleased have both yourself and the manager been at how well the players have have switched the focus back to Mats after the cup final because it it could have really been easy to have been distracted by that but it's been two really good solid wins off the back of all the celebration yeah we've been really pleased as as I said earlier you know after such a big high it's easy to sort of almost lose your focus a little bit and sort of get a little bit distracted with everything that's gone on and all the talk around the city but I said you know we've got a fantastic group of players uh they know the expectations they know the demands that are put on them and the manager drives that every single day uh you know one thing about Eddie he won't let anybody sort of almost take themselves to a place other than where they're meant to be and that's their daily work and to deliver the performance and psychologically they know they need to to be where where they need to be in their head to be able to go and deliver them type of performances two tough games Brenford at home and Leicester away where you probably expected to win but everybody was looking at you to see how you was going to perform after the cup final and it was important that we went and delivered the results that we did uh and it sets us up now nicely for for the remaining eight games thank you thank you Andy jess good to see you um you've seen it all in your time at Newcastle so far we've talked about the memes of course you know the clubs being rene but now the trophy success Champions League of course season i just wondered how you'd kind of sum up your time at Newcastle so far i imagine it's quite difficult to pick uh it's certainly been a a great journey for us for sure and one that you know we we wouldn't have expected uh certainly so soon you know there's been some some incredible sort of moments and achievements along along the journey uh and yeah absolutely delighted you know we knew what the football club meant to the city sort of arriving here uh we knew the football club hadn't won a trophy for so long and uh and the importance of trying to achieve that and you know it was one of our goals when we arrived and we spoke about you know wanting to try and do that and deliver that uh and you know we're honored to be able to have helped the football club sort of win their first trophy in such a long time uh but you know for us it don't stop there you know the most important thing for us now is you know Manchester United and and focusing on that and making sure that you know we deliver the performances week in week out and get that consistency that will hopefully lead to more success yeah looking at the present day how many times have the players or the coaches indeed even tried to copy Fabian Sher's assist from Monday night on the training pitch this week i love to say that we was you know we taught him everything uh about the strike but no uh I think Fab's been at the football club a long time we know uh he's got that in his locker he scored some fantastic goals from long distance uh during his time at Newcastle uh and he's got that creative brain where you know he he can deliver that type of shot uh it's just a shame that it wasn't an inch or two lower to to actually go in because it would have been uh an incredible goal but uh you know we know Fab is capable of that obviously you don't expect it uh but it was it was a great moment and you know Jacob Murphy done incredibly well to follow it in and and to finish the the rebound speaking of strikes from long range I imagine you like anyone else this week saw Declan Rice's two free kicks against Real Madrid when you do watch those moments not that you need any extra motivation to make Champions League but you see those fantastic moments at the highest end of the game does it drive you on even further you and the players to be at Europe's top table again uh yeah of course you know when you see not necessarily the goals but them type of games you know I think every every player will tell you they want to be playing in them them top games and you know we've experienced some uh ourselves in in our time at Newcastle the players have you know the cup final a few weeks ago was a great occasion and you know them type of games you want to sort of play in all the time uh got to say you know the two free kicks from Declan Rice was was fantastic two different techniques but the execution was was top and you know I think it was a fantastic performance for Arsenal uh but as I said you know they're the type of games as a player as a coach as a manager you want to be involved in just finally about Manchester United this weekend do you feel like the rivalries with those so-called big clubs the Arsenals the Liverpools of the world the Manchester United of the world that we saw between Newcastle in these clubs in the 1990s perhaps they're starting to simmer and to rise again do you reckon uh I think any team that play against Man United and Arsenal or Liverpool is is a big game and obviously Newcastle is a huge club themselves uh and there's always been that rivalry there between you know Newcastle Man United and uh and as I said you know sort of really the last question like they're the type of games as a player and as a coaching manager they're the type of games you want to be involved in uh we know it's going to be a fantastic atmosphere at St james's Park it always is when we play against Man United and it's down to us to go and deliver a performance that that wins us the game and uh you know they're they're a good side they've only lost one in their last six so there certainly a different side to the one that we faced at Old Trafford so we you know we know we need to be at our best to to deliver a performance that does it thanks Jason thanks Andy Nisha morning Jason with Manu having the game midweek just yesterday how do you balance that desire for the intensity particularly at St james's Park fans will want you to take advantage of perhaps a slightly tired and new team but balancing that with the incredibly busy week that you've got you know I think it's three games in six days yeah it's our only focus sort of like now is we're not necessarily focusing on Crystal Palace and and Aston Villa because I don't think you can and you can't really sort of prepare for anything other than sort of Man United and you know the most important thing for us is to make sure we get that bit right uh and deliver the performance obviously they played last night uh but I've seen sort of time and time again sometimes that can work in your favor where you sort of got that rhythm of games and uh as I said you know they're they're in a good runner form certainly in the in the Premier League of recently where they've only lost one and six so they'll be come to St james Park expecting a good performance and and the result uh you know you all the top teams Man City Liverpool Arsenal you know they'll go and deliver three top performances in a week and go and get free results and you know I think Man United is more than capable of coming to St james's Park and and delivering a top performance uh we just got to make sure that we're at our best to make sure that you know we're the ones that come out on top and just finally for me you've spoken about you know the Carabal Cup the Champions League all you've achieved but I guess that's all kind of part of that has been from what you as a team of coaches have done some of the players that have already been here like Joe Linton transforming him into the midfielder who he is now like Jacob Murphy who's had this renaissance can you give us an insight into how you as coaches have worked on that kind of man for man improvement of players i think as a coach as a manager uh certainly with the way the manager and myself and the wrestler coaches work you know the you know part of your job and the most important thing is to try and improve you know every individual player let's hit the football club that's your duty that's what we try and do there's not just one way of doing that there's you know there's individual work there's unit work there's teamwork there's analysis there's conversations uh so there's there's a a lot of work that actually goes into it that actually then you know where where you end up seeing sort of the end outcome so to speak but uh you know every player can improve and as well as them players have done up until this point they know there's still improvement and there's still growth in their own per in their own performances and collectively as a team and you know our job as coaches is to push them and to drive them every single day to try and be the best that they can be uh and have the best career that they can possibly have thanks Nisha we'll go to Damian Sparman Lee Ryder and Ian Mercer hi Jason there's a lot to Eddie about this in recent weeks but how has life changed for you and your family in the week since the cup final uh obviously you know it gives you a greater understanding of what it actually means to to the people of the city you know people spoke about it uh before the last cup final against Man United uh and in the buildup to this one if we're to win it sort of you got no idea what what it would mean but you never probably quite understand until that moment happens uh as I say you know I think the city's been on such a high since uh since we won the cup final uh you realize what it means to everybody but in terms of does it change our lives and what we do uh I think in this game you have to quickly move on and think about you know the the next game so to speak so you don't get too much time to actually dwell on it and uh reflect on it it'll probably only be come the end of the season when you reflect on the season as a whole and and realized you know what a great achievement it it was but uh as I say you know our only focus is is trying to you know prepare the team uh to go out there and deliver consistent performances and you and Eddie would have had an idea of the club's potential when you arrived here how has that changed over the last three and a half years no different i think everybody knows what a huge club Newcastle is uh and we knew that before we come here i think when you're actually here you sort of almost get a greater understanding and realize that even more uh but you know every club wants success every club wants their team to deliver good performances and win games and uh you know that's you know our job when we arrived here was to try and uh do the best we can and to try and be as successful is what we uh try and be as successful as we can and uh so far it's been a great journey but as we know uh you know you can't dwell on the past you know because it'll come back and you know sort of shoot you down very quickly so we have to focus on on what we do dayto-day and try and make sure that there's more successful moments to come thanks Damian Lee Ryder morning um just on Bruno Girez has been pictured doing a bit of fishing with some of the backling team don't know if you were invited or involved or not but uh how important is it that the players do something in between games that gets them nice and relaxed yeah I did see that actually uh the post with Bruno uh and I I just think it just goes to show how tight and how close everybody is you know it's not often that you know you'll see the captain of a team going fishing with uh with staff members and I think that's you know testament to to Bruno himself and uh the the tight-knit group that we've we've got and we've created here at the football club and I think it is important for players to switch off there's uh so much uh pressure on their shoulders and there's a lot of talk and there's a lot of demand that they have to deal with so uh I think when the moments come where they sort of have a free day or couple of days to themselves it's important that they do switch off recharge their batteries and uh and come back fresh again and it was great just to see Bruno uh fish him with a couple of staff members i'm sure he had a great day uh not spoke to him in too much detail about it but you know it was great to see for from our perspective and uh yeah it's really important just Ott Man United obviously there's been some famous games in the past do you tap into those games with the what the fans loved or do you have to be your own version of Newcastle United no I think we have to be the own version of ourselves uh like we always are i think you know we can't try and uh be a team that we're not we have to you know prepare for the game uh like we do every single every single week each opposition is different they have different strengths and weaknesses and it it's for us to try and exploit that and make sure we deliver a performance that we feel is is good enough to win the game and you know that's the only focus right now is to make sure we get the players in that place where they can go out there feel confident to go and deliver a performance that that does that for us thanks Le got to Ian Mer Luke Edwards and then Chris Watson good morning Jason a lot a lot of managers say that when playing the so-called big six it presents not just footballing challenges but mental challenges as well recent evidence suggests that Newcastle have overcome those hurdles you've beaten Arsenal three times Manchester United away Liverpool Wembley was there a certain point in time or specific game when you realize you're going in against these elite teams on with a level playing field on equal terms did it feel it felt different this season do you know what we we haven't really looked at it in that way uh as I say uh you know we don't sort of probably look back at you know past results and and analyze it in in that way you know our only focus always is you know on the next game and how can we best get a result in that game and what have we got to do and deliver to to try and do that that you know we do back ourselves uh against any team we come up against certainly now we're confident that you know if we can go out there and deliver the performance we know we're capable of then you know we'll be a uh a tough game for anybody uh not just in the Premier League in Europe and I think we've proved that so many times this season Newcast already laid a 70 year old winning winning domestic silverware are you aware it's 95 years since Newcastle did the double over Manchester United on the presenter motivation itself no not aware of that uh and it's probably you know we we won't use that uh because I think sometimes you know these things can probably put a little bit more pressure on you know unnecessary pressure on on players uh we just need to go out there and and and deliver a performance that's good enough to win the game and you know hopefully we can go out there and do that and if we do then you know it'll be a lovely record to to sort of uh to achieve it's been a hell of a long time as you say uh but our only focus is to go out there and and deliver the performance not what's happened in the past thanks Luke Edwards eddie's attention to detail is well known do you think he'll look back on this press conference and analyze your performance knowing I'm surprised he probably got a live feed there now but no his attention to detail is is top and that's why he's uh you know one of the best managers that that's out there uh certainly now uh we know what a top manager he is the attention to detail that uh that he goes through and I think that's why you know as a manager he's had the career that he's had with that in mind be honest after 17 years ever have you quite enjoyed a few days break at work this week no do you know what uh no but as I say we've been in constant dialogue all the time uh it's really unusual for for Ed to to not be well enough to come to work so uh we still speak on the phone uh you know uh miss not having him here uh we work well together and you know I'm sure he'll be back very soon thank you thanks Luke that's Chris Woff Scott Wilson and Jordan Cronin please morning just checking on Alex's fitness because obviously he's had this this injury been carrying for the last couple years is he fully fit going into the weekend he's trained the the last couple of days he's he's trained and and feels fine uh it's one that we we assess day by day uh but you know we're expecting him to to hopefully be available and fit for the weekend with it being a three game week is he fit enough to start three games inside a week or is he going to need to be managed during the next week uh as I say you know we're not really looking uh ahead of Man United i think you know our main focus is Man United and you know making sure that we deliver that performance and uh you know what happens after that is you know the time when we'll reflect and assess each individual player uh and make that call sort of after that game going into the Crystal Palace game okay just conscious of time particularly with the Sundays in mind so we'll get through as many of you as we can we'll start with Scott we'll go to Jordan Dominic no okay jordan Dominic and um back Jason Miller please jason a bit of a light one but you've been yellow card twice this season i think the 30 goes in a touch line bar can you can you avoid that yeah uh yeah no I can you know it's not often uh you know that I do pick up any any cards i know this season obviously picked up the the two yellow cards uh thought they was both probably a little bit harsh but then I'm going to say that aren't I uh but uh yeah no of course you know I've got a good relationship with you know with with the the officials and you know that's got to be on my best behavior thank you no just one from me Jason um semi-automated offside technology being introduced this weekend in the Premier League it was the technology that saw late winter ruled out against Brighton in their FA Cup last month do you welcome that change just what are your thoughts on I think everyone welcomes any change that's going to uh make the the league better uh and make these decisions a lot quicker so it's difficult to to probably answer that question now without sort of probably experiencing uh you know the the format and how it's going to work and how quick it's going to be but you know if it improves the the speed of decisions then of course we welcome that decision yeah for sure jason Miller well hi Jason e such a pro you probably wanted to come in and coach off his sick bed I would imagine did you have to put your foot down and tell him to stay at home there's a risk of the nobody else no no one else is uh got it as I say it's really unusual for Fred not to be well enough to come to work so you know he has been uh he has been sick the last couple of days and no doubt he's he's been itching to to come in and you know to continue his day-to-day work but you know I think when you're feeling under the weather and poorly and you know with all the pressures that that is on the manager's shoulders I think you need to make sure that you're you know you're ready to come back to be able to then work efficiently effectively uh and be at your best and you know uh I'm sure when Ed comes back you know we'll see the Eddie how that you know he's is there for every game and you know uh a top manager on the sidelines but you can only do that I think when you're 100% and I think that's the most important thing for Eddie now just separately you're coming up against one of the worst goalkeepers in Manchester United history i wouldn't say that uh I wouldn't say say that at all i think is is a top top goalkeeper and like every player you know every player on the football pitch makes mistakes uh and I think he's no different to anybody else but we're not looking it that way uh seen Matson deliver some top performances in golf for Man United uh but I certainly wouldn't I certainly wouldn't agree with them comments you know myself thanks Jason we'll go to Kieran to finish this section please been used to a certain group of teams dominating the top few spots in the Premier League do you feel that's changing that's no longer a closed shop i don't think it is i think there's so many good teams in the Premier League now as we've seen uh you know it's incredibly tough to to win games uh you know you're always going to get the top teams that are going to be there and thereabouts and you know there's going to be teams that want to try and break into that sort of league and I think we're seeing that now you know Aston Villa's doing doing really well brighton Fulham uh you know you Chelsea's Tottenham's Man City's Liverpools Arsenal they're all going to be there still uh you know everybody's fighting for the same thing but probably long gone is the days where maybe it was the top two or three teams sort of every season that would be there or thereabouts uh I think the competition is really tough and you know it's getting harder year by year funny has the coupling made you hungry for horses or it's been so long trying to get the first one is there sense you you want to get another next season of course i think you know that's that's what you live for uh that's why you play that's why you coach and manages to you know for for their moments to be successful and to try and win silverware uh you know it was a great achievement for the football club uh but it doesn't stop there you know we're hungry for more and you know we we do everything in our power to to try and achieve that as a football club collectively
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,y4A5WWEmXh0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4A5WWEmXh0,good morning Eddie uh firstly Fabian Sher new contract announced by the club yesterday how pleased are you to um extend his stay with Newcastle yeah firstly let me start by saying if I speak a little bit funny had a day at the dentist yesterday so apologies if I sound a bit weird uh try and get through normally um Fabian yeah delightedly signed delighted um he's been really good this year for us uh trains trains well very popular within the the squad he's contributed he's been an ever presentes really when he's been fit um so yeah really pleased that he's committed want to ask you about a couple of players that have been carrying knocks he mentioned after the match on Wednesday night that Kieran tripier was feeling um an issue in his groin and Alexander esack as well how are they doing I wait and see today really Razer um of course I've had medical updates yesterday but I see them for the first time today so hopefully they're feeling okay we don't think we've got any big injury from Wednesday night but we've certainly got a few niggles so let's wait and see and how is Anthony Gordon doing and has he returned to full training ahead of Leicester no he hasn't no not yet he's another one that we're we're monitoring we think he's um he's still recovering really from the really really bad knock he got for England which still got a huge bruising on his leg so um he's done individual training he's not done Group Training he's still not feeling 100% pain for free so again let's wait and see in Gordon's absence through suspension Harvey Barnes has started the last three matches and has done well for you hasn't he um it's been a while since he's had a run in the team but how pleased have you been with his performances yeah really pleased I think Harvey um been trumping at the bit to play he's been desperate to Showcase what he can do he brings unique things to the to the team he's definitely a goal uh a goal threat I think he had seven shots against brenford um off both sides of the pitch um I trust him a lot I think he's I think he's got a lot of great attributes that we want in the team so I've been really happy and been really happy with how he's come into the team and built relationships with lik of Joe Linton and um Tino liento who's playing on the other side I think they've done really well they've been um a consistent threat down that left hand side so delighted with that side of the pitch and can this be an opportunity for Barnes to stay in the team think back to earlier in the season when Anthony Gordon was playing on the right at times Harvey Barn scored a lot of goals was on the left since then Jacob Murphy's been in incredible form but he's had the opportunity and I suppose if he keeps playing well then he could stay there yeah I think that's the the message to any player um when you get your opportunity you've got to try and take it you've got to try and grab it and make it impossible for me to take you out so that's the challenge for Harvey and hopefully he continues to play well what do you think about the situation Leicester are in um they're on a long run of defeats and quite a way back from safety now it looks tough for them but mathematically they're not out of it no they're not out of it and I think they'll believe they still have a a chance I think I I always look at how a team plays and I think Leicester have been very competitive the results um don't necessarily show that but I look back to the Manchester United game where I thought they were win the game and they had chances to score um and then the result is is really deceiving I think and the overall strength of their team and I think that's been consistent for them so we know they're dangerous we know they've got good players Jamie vard is still a massive threat um he brings his unique qualities that we're going to need to control um yeah R rude's got his team playing good football as well so we're going to have to be on our guard there's no easy games at this level thanks Riser Keith Eddie just one for me if you don't mind um an posted coo last night um unhappy at the amount of time it was taking for a v check and and decision um as a as a fellow manager do you do you understand that how do you feel about the length of time it takes yeah I think I was looking at it from the supporters perspective and I don't think you want V decisions to take that long generally I think we want a quick a quicker process 6 minutes is too long I didn't actually see the incident at the time but yeah that that that's far too long for me and uh you know I feel for the the supporters more than anybody Andy on Eddie talk about the players team news uh no one likes dentist work it's been the work are you okay it's been quite a bit in there yeah it's all good though it's all good good uh Sandra tanali everyone I think was trying to wrap the heads around the maths weren't they the other night 70% cross 30% shot have you worked out the maths yet and do your players need to be a little bit less honest because if he' said he gone for it could have been looking at a pussc award next year yeah I didn't spend any time doing the maths um I was hoping that you'd have done it for me um yeah now Sandro's answered the question as he sees fit I think um I don't know I think there's always a bit of when you're making decisions on the pitch there's always lots of different thoughts going through your mind he struck it I think he's probably looking to hit it low and hard into the box and create um a difficult moment for brentford's Defenders so who to you know take the intent away from him seriously speaking on that Midfield I think all we did at the start of the season was talk about the Midfield balance of that Midfield three now that they've found the balance is this one of the best balanced midfielders in the pre midfields in the Premier League right now between Sandro Bruno and Joel Inson yeah I think it's difficult for me to to give sort of a definitive answer but I think just looking at those individual players they all bring something different and I think that when you talk about balance that's what you want so you want the creativity that Bruno can bring us the good decision- making that Sandro brings us and then joon's physical presence sort of add that together and you've got a little bit of everything although you can think that before bringing them together sometimes the chemistry you can't you can't measure chemistry is just as important um that's why you see some players play better with others and you there sometimes there's no logic behind it it just happens because the players Express themselves in that way together I think that they're getting there I think with every game maybe the understanding of each other gets better and stronger but then you add Joe willick to the mix you had the other midfielders um Shan longstaff Lou Miley we've got good players in that position and they all have big strengths that we need we spoke about how important that brenford win was but is it the nature of that sort of gritty performance produced consistently that's going to be the difference between potentially Champions League football and and no Champions League football this season yeah possibly I think finding a way to win in in really tight games is key and that was one where you're looking one one with period of the game left you're thinking about how how do we find a way to win we weren't necessarily the dominant team and that that moment we were early in the game we'd lost that a little bit and you go back to games like Fulham which we ended up losing uh that can really hurt you so um yes I'd like to think that we're getting more experience and more confidence as the games go by and I think we understand that the tight games are the ones that really matter just finally great to see Fabian extend his deal here at Newcastle United what what do you think in in years and years to come supporters will kind of look back on and remember Fabian how do you think they'll remember remember him as a Newcastle United player over years I think they remember him as the unique player that he is I think a Defender that's not Orthodox he does things that he probably shouldn't be doing like his finish against Liverpool he has no right to score from there and I can add other goals to that where you think wow um class he's just got moments where you you go wow what a pass I think he did one against brenford the other day where he passed into Alex's feet from 30 yards away I don't think anyone sees that pass on the pitch um I think he's defensive worked since I've been here definitely improved and and I think as a Defender you're always judged against that first so he was part of a defensive unit that conceded the joint lowest number of goals in the Premier League I think he'll take probably as much pride from that as he will as the other bits of his game so um he needs to continue that Improvement thanks Andy Jerry morning Edie morning um just to pick up on the injuries uh point you said after the brenford game I think you words were that you have a W for thin Squad not for the first time um how much of a concern for you is that for the coming weeks yeah especially with the the number of games we've got in a short period of time we have I think three games in six days that will be a testing period for us um but yeah we just got to try and manage and navigate this period really sensibly with the players that we do have fit we need to look after everybody I think if we can get a a good strong team on the pitch I think we're good enough um Leicester haven't won a point and I don't think they've scored even in their last seven games so it's going to be tempting for fans to think this has got to be with current form a bound to win game but given that you've described your running as like having nine Cup finals is it fair to say of all the nine games this is a must-win game I think they're all must-win games I don't think we look any any game any differently um and we respect every opponent and we respect Leicester and we know that they have qualities and if we drop our levels as we found many times this season already uh what the media will categorize into one group of game it doesn't exist so we need to go there with our best attitude and our best performance did you see enough from the brenford game to convince you that after all the excitement and the joy and the the highs of the last few weeks that the players are 100% refocused now or is it good to get to keep some of that momentum and that pride in in these next few games to say well if we can beat Liverpool we can beat anybody yeah I think of course you need to take the confidence confidence is so fragile as we know so when you have it you don't want to lose it and you don't lose it by by being um professional you don't lose it by giving your best in training every day and I think that's the sort of this time is where we have to really double down on our standards and make sure we're professional which we have been um I'm pleased we got the brenford game out the way and I please we won I think we'll improve from the game I've got no doubt we can play better than that thanks thank you thanks Jerry we've got a Damian sparman Lee Ridder than Ian merer Eddie you spoke the other night about Tino and how what he's done Since switching SS in the last few games when you when you bought him you obviously bought a player of potential but could you have expected him to have developed as quickly as he has and what is the challenge to him now yeah had known Tino or what not not known him personally but watched him for a long time um knew and watched him at Chelsea really excited by him watched him on the international stage at Youth Level watched him for Southampton in his first taste of the Premier League and I thought he was out you know really really good um but you never know how the progress of that player will fit into your philosophy and your way of working and also how his character will fit with the squads again another really popular member of the dressing room really well liked he's got a really laid-back but professional manner um I've been really impressed with how he's adapted to playing on the opposite side of the pitch he did it for us last season and did it really well for a number of games and he's done it well again um and arguably if anything attacks better off that left hand side than he has off the right which you know he hung up a couple of crosses recently off his left foot one for Joe willick against Brighton on one right at the start of the brenford game which Alex um nearly scored from uh he shows his left foot is very very strong Le just um with Alex is a groin injury something he's been carrying no I don't think he's been carrying I think it was in the warm-up of the game before brenford just became aware of it I believe um and sort of carried that through the game and I'm just looking back on the international fixures I was watching as he was playing full 90 minutes against Northern Ireland uh and 61 minutes against Luxembourg do you have any control over that do you have any sort of communication with with Sweden on that one no we wouldn't have any control over that if he's declared fit the national team manager will have full rights to do what he wants with the player but I think Sweden would recognize that we have to look after him they would want to look after him they want to keep him fit just as much as we do um yeah I just think it's one of those things Alex felt good going into the game there was no no problems and I think sometimes you just have to let the players play now he felt something but it was wasn't enough to stop him he felt he could play wanted a play scored so we pleased with that and now we got to try and make sure he's fit for Leicester thanks Lee uh got to in M Chris wol and Jordan C good morning Eddie uh Jacob Murphy yet another assistant on Wednesday night he's always had um good runs in the side under your management but uh this season it's he's become almost a permanent fixture back in August did you honestly see him playing this number of games yeah I think Jacob's been excellent for me um since I've been at the football club I think he's always got that ability to affect games and he's always had that he's a very very good Crosser of the ball as we saw against brenford I mean the ball he put in for Alex was pinpoint and he's done that consistently and those two players will be it from longer range than a normal really um telepathic relationship of course M's crossing the ball a lot of the time from from wide Alex seems to know where the ball's going to go so um yeah they've developed a really good relationship but I think murf's been excellent I think he's been creative he's defended really well as well for a wide player he's very diligent we ask him to do different jobs as we did against brenford did it really well his tactical understanding is really high just on another player at beginning of the Season sha longf was was the Midfield you needed in the side to win games he's become something of a forgotten man not not with you obviously but but uh in the outside world what what is his role in in the in the weeks ahead and his future in Newcastle yeah well his role is to be ready be ready to play be ready to come on and I've trusted him in big games where he has come on and uh played his part in the wins that you you mention um we're going to need the whole Squad to help us in our league season we've got nine massive games to come everybody needs to be ready to play I think his long-term future is slightly more unclear um but all I can say behind the scenes Sean's been very very good he's been um helping the group he's been training to a really high level can't speak highly enough of him as a person thanks Chris more Eddie last season it was sort well documented that away from home the team had a lot of struggles this year I think you're fourth in the in the Premier League a away table I know that you said that was something you wanted to address why do you think the form has been so different um a difficult one to give to give absolute Clarity on that I do think we have a good counterattacking team and naturally I think sometimes when you're away from home you'll end up counterattacking a little bit more I think we got good Pace I think we are a threat in those moments but I think your away form is always based on on character it's always based on resilience it's always based on your ability to defend first and um if you have a solid foundation I think you got a chance of winning games so I um I'd probably put it down to that as the first portal now we know early season we had a few issues defensively I think we've improved of late been pleased to see us become a bit more um harder to score against and still that's an area we need to focus on and just on that as well Alexander isach of his 20 goals 10 of them have been away from home as well sometimes you get it with Strikers where they're almost score more at home and maybe struggle away from home how have you managed to really get him those goals away from how how is he we improve that as well yeah well you're right it's a great stat to have because you don't want to become home dominant um you don't want to be able to just perform in front of the Newcastle supporters and with that positive feel you got to do it in every environment um I think how we've tried to do it is be consistent so we don't change the way we play depending on whether we're home or away we always tactically tweak things depending on who we're playing but there's not a a mindset shift when we're away from home I I don't believe in that okay Jordan Cronin Craig H and Martin Hardy how is Jordan do you expect him to play through the little niggle injury that he's got we hope so yeah he'd be another one in the category that's got a niggle um but knowing Joey he'll probably um say he's fine today and good to train so we' have to manage him and we'll have to look after him and um yeah try and navigate the next few days and how's the last three gam show exactly why you want to keep ke Tri out the football club not just because of you that ship but because he's still a very very good footballer yeah I think Kieran has been excellent in the last two games and again if you look at his direct opponent I think he's done a really good job on them I think he's shown that he can still defend which is as a Defender the first pter call can you defend well enough um and the resounding answer to that has been yes it's unquestioned his ability on the ball um and we need to work better as a team to try and get him in the final third a little bit more because he's attacking play and he's Crossing his second and n as well so I'm really really pleased with Kieran it's been a very good return to the team thank you Greg more that uh I I appreciate this question comes to the time when we're discussing Alex potentially having a knock and being a doubt for Monday but this idea that Alex continues to be injury prone to a degree is that a myth you actually look at the stats and there's only Bruno and Dan Burns started more Premier League games in him this season and their play every week how have you got him to that point where he's able to score 20 goals in consecutive seasons and is that nonsense now this idea that he does have a an issue with injuries yeah I'd say from speaking on my behalf as a very injury PR prone player as you look at my record uh that's an injury prone player Alex certainly isn't um he's had issues I think with a groin problem that tends to rear its head now and then um it came to the FL just before we played Liverpool but with rest he was he was fine and he was good to go and played really well in the Cup Final and for whatever reason it it just resurfaced before brenford but I think it's a minor very minor problem that will go away quite quickly in terms of that bigger picture with regards Fitness is it as much a a mindset thing at times have you worked on Alex if you look at his Fitness record and his time at the club it's actually got better and better he's he's availability is that something you've worked on physically or mentally well I think it's something we work on physic physically sorry with all of our players I think there's a there's a myth that if you train lightly and don't do too much with them then everyone will be fit for the Saturday it's actually the opposite you've got to work your players you got to build up their robust so when the game comes they're able to execute what they need to execute and they can do it with no problem so it's getting them on the training ground consistently and the players that miss training regularly they're they're the become the problem players so for Alex Alex has been a regular trainer um he's been there he's done the work he's trained very well and that's reflected I think in his performances okay go Martin Hardy Kieran Kelly and Lise Taylor Martin hi Eddie along the similar lines with regards to Alex you have seen a significant increase in his appearance from year one to year two to year three so how have you managed him and have you made him more robust for the Premier League well we've tried to I think he he's very professional I have to say that regarding Alex he has his would say his own physio but he has a a physio that he uses um in conjunction with the football club that uh he'll fly in and fly out and but we we certainly back that we we've got good relationships with um the people that try and look after him and of course we have our own staff and he's got staff members here he's very close with it's about building those relationships and that trust so that he knows that we're doing the right work for him and his body um and then of course Alex has to be professional himself in the times where we don't see him and he has to look after himself and dedicate himself with football it's the only way he's going to get to the the absolute top and maximize his career and does he have a different kind of uh physique for number nine um and is that where you have to kind of work with them yeah everything has to be individualized um for him because he's not um the same as say for example Callum Wilson or Willa they're very different physical profiles so the work you do with them has to match that profile so yeah we do that with all our players we try and individualize everything give them individually what they need for their own benefit and how much more is there still to come from Alex in what sense physically as a player as a player no there's loads more to come there's loads more and I believe that with with everybody if I didn't I'd be the wrong coach for him thanks M kieren uh morning uh Sandro felt a very unique signing at the time um given this small poo of players that actually improve the team the rules will you be able to bring in that sort of profile again or do you think you have to recruit differently now um yeah with with Sandro it was it was a tough transfer I mean it wasn't uh it wasn't an easy deal to get over the line um in the respect that you have to get everyone to agree and that includes Milan that includes Sandro his Representatives they have to see that as the best move for him in his career at that moment that's not an easy thing to do for such a high-profile player um at such a such a big Club so um of course Champions League football helped our cause massively um but yeah it was a tough deal but we're delighted to get over the line now I I don't know if we can look at it in isol any deal in isolation I think we have to sorry as a as a sort of an overview you have to look at it in isolation you have to look at and go we have this positional need who's the best player to fill it I don't think you can go in going it's not going to be a high-profile player or it's going to be a younger player you have to look what you need in that position given how how stressful last summer was with the relationships now place do you feel you're in a better position to attack that window or maybe I'd like to think we're in a better position um regarding PSR and I think that's the that's the key thing last summer we knew from the outset it was going to be very very difficult ult um and it turned out to be that way so hopefully this season or this summer sorry has a totally different view thanks go to Louise then we'll finish with Dominic skirt hi hi Eddie um there was um talking of Kieran trip here who's obviously been playing so fantastically well there was just over a year ago there was that bid from Bayern Munich there was obviously serious interest and with the PSR situation there was perhaps an argument that it was tempting to to sell him at that stage in his career in his in his life did you have to fight very hard to keep him and if so do you feel Vindicated now I think regarding I think there's misleading things regarding PSR because every deal you can look at on paper but the actual PSR effect is totally different but once you've gone through the whole detail of what it what it means so I don't think there's any big PSR benefit from selling Kieran and I think that does factor into a lot of our decision- making um just purely from a football perspective there's no way I wanted to lose him he was too important and he remains too important on various levels um we need his experience his winning mentality um and his quality on the pitch did you have to have some difficult conversations with him when he wasn't in the team because he obviously wants to to play and he's a key influence on the squad you can see him when he's been a sub you know shouting instructions and I mean did you have to sit down with him and and discuss things I think I always communicate with the players but I have to say Kieran handled himself impeccably when he was out the team he trained really well he supported the players and you can see that shouting on the touchline is genuine he wants to help he wants the team to win very selfless that's what makes him the leader that he is thanks Louise Dominic morning Eddie um you touch on Fabian shar's contract Sean Long staff's long-term future maybe being slightly unclear does the guarantee of European football for next season almost Focus your plans in the transfer market and maybe impact players who stay at the club and who are handed New Deals yeah I think Europe will play a part in that quite how that looks I don't know because we haven't sat and had those discussions yet I think there's far too much football to be played but I think we' be in a stronger position for the the better competition that we're in and our aim is to try and do as well as we can of course but I think for the current players we know that um we know where we want to be and what we want to try and Achieve so uh all aims are on that at the moment so in terms of new contract announcements you wouldn't expect anything more before the end of the season who knows
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,gNf7foh_JZg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNf7foh_JZg,"morning everyone welcome back to the media center uh we are here obviously ahead of brenford tomorrow evening uh usual things on your microphones it's been a little while uh please keep your phones away from them if you can uh we'll start with razor please good morning Eddie morning before uh ask you about brenford can we just have some more words about Saturday the parade and then the event on the Town Mall I mean it was a really special day wasn't it for everybody connected with the club yeah an amazing day um still some vivid memories of it and I think just a massive thank you to everybody that turned up it was cold so for the supporters to wait like they did in those conditions was an incredible effort so yeah big thank you obviously not everybody that wanted to be at Wembley could be at Wembley so how nice was it to be able to have those moments on Saturday with so many more people estimated 300, across the day yeah it just goes to show I think the the numbers that we have that are willing to support the team and as you say um not everyone could get to Wembley and we know football is expensive to either to travel or to to buy tickets for games so that was an opportunity for everyone on mass to come and support um the team and and show their love and it was it was an amazing day and it shows the power that football possesses that it can change people's mood um can change the city's mood uh and it I just just think it was a a great day for everyone connected with Newcastle and as big as the last couple of weeks have been how much are you looking forward to playing again tomorrow yeah I think we are I think it's we enjoyed the break I think we enjoyed sort of the line going through the the cut final knowing we had a bit of time to absorb what what happened in that game thankfully it was positive um but I think now we're ready to play again I think we've been ready to play again for a while I think that's what we do and we're still in the middle the season so it's it's it's quite a long break and we've had to try and navigate that as well as we can um with all the emotion around the game that we've just had hopefully we're ready to play um of course we've had a split group we've had quite small numbers um only recently we've now got the group back together and I think we're focused on the next match and how exciting could the next couple of months be because you're in a really strong position in the Premier League 10 matches to go and having had great success a couple of weeks ago there's still so much more than you can achieve isn't there yeah there is and I think has been a case of resetting and looking at our goals again in a in a different way um we need to put the what happened against Liverpool to the back of our minds and now really focus on on the future as you say 10 games 10 10 great opportunities for us really to to grab and try and um turn our Premier League season into a memorable season as well as the as the the Cup Final so um we looking forward to it hopefully the lads are boosted and have renewed confidence in what we can be because against Liverpool I thought we were outstanding and that's now how we be measured against and finally brenford who you beat in the um in the League Cup in December just a couple of weeks after you played them in the Premier League which is one of your biggest disappointments of the Season probably that result and performance um I guess you know how good and how dangerous they can be yeah absolutely it was it was a a very diff ult day that one um looking back I think it acted as a bit of a catalyst for us in terms of regrouping um trying to change our season's uh momentum after that we went on a really good winning run we had some uh thorough analysis of that game and sort of where we were in that moment so we know that brenford a very good team and of course yes as you said we played him in the caribel cup on the way to the the final that was another tough game so we know their strengths very good Thomas has done an an incredible job very good from set plays still got some really big strengths in their game and their away forms um sort of turn around early season it was the home form was really strong now their away forms really strong so they've been free scoring as well very high scoring team this year so it should be a good game thanks Razer Keith Ed Eddie I guess it's an unusual position to be in sort of three quarters of the way through the season you've just won a a cup final and you've got as you said there are 10 huge games to come how do you go about ensuring the players retain that focus and there's not any hangover from the Cup Final yeah I think we've tried to do a lot of work in between um The Lads coming back together we we trained really hard in in Dubai and we we had a sort of a group of I say three or four really hard training sessions back here um but now the groups back together we've really tried to refocus on the future and I think that's always the important thing there's always another game there's always the next moment and we have to focus on that and not look back too much in this moment so that's what we tried to do and um yeah we're excited about what we can be because I think the the Liverpool game as I said was was a great performance and showed the the capabilities the team has now we need to try and hit that consistently I know you wanted to enjoy the the cup final but be honest when did your mind switch at which point over the last two weeks did it switch to brenford really honestly um it was the next day after Liverpool because it it's just how I'm wired it's how I'm built and I tried to sort of have a word with myself and change how I am but I couldn't so I was back watching the Liverpool game the next day on my own analyzing the game and and going through it for what we need to improve so that was yeah I can't change who I am and so I enjoyed that because it was a good performance you always enjoy when you play well and then it was um case of watching brenford the same day and straight straight back to work gone quite easy on yourself this time alone didn't you yeah I gave myself a night so uh that was that was quite rare um you've obviously got a couple of you had a few injury problems going into the I can't remember if it was before or after the West Ham game now but one of them being Sven botman have you got any time skill as to as to when you return Yes sven's not too bad he's he's had an operation a very minor operation just to clean out a bit of floating bone that was in his knee that was causing him the problem um I think uh the initial diagnosis I think was between 6 to 8 weeks um but I think he's already got through a two or three of those so he's on the road he's feeling good um fingers crossed we'll see him probably in May sometime and Anthony Gordon after out of England yeah Anthony has a really nasty bruise in and around his his thigh stroke groin area um he's up up and running feeling quite good we haven't he hasn't trained with the group yet so we anticipate to do that within the next few days hopefully and just Finly from me um those scenes on Saturday I think you described it as as mindblowing are those are sort of scenes that you think could sort of attract other players to come to Newcastle and in the future and say look this is this is what we've got here this is the emotional connection with the fans and also you know allow hopefully to to keep certain players at the club and they might have felt that emotional connection on Saturday yeah I think it can only enhance that Keith I think it's very difficult to say whether have a tangible effect in the transfer market for us but I think I think we've seen the power of Newcastle in a positive force uh globally I'm sure the world's looked at us and whatever your opinion on on how we've reacted to the cut win you can see the the city's United um the football club is incredibly well supported there's a a connection um that's unique uh and I think that only puts us in a really positive light thanks Keith Andy on Eddie um there were I think fans falling from trees they were perched on statues Etc but in amongst all of that chaos when you saw your kind of flag being Dre to what was that moment exactly like for you as a person take away the football manager what was it like for you as a person I think you've also miss heads going through um advertising boards which was a unique one uh so there there were some sites there that you think there was one particular person I think how's he got there and how's he going to get down more importantly that that's that's the other amazing thing so it was uh incredible but yeah the flag the flag moment was totally unexpected didn't didn't know it was there didn't know it was coming um I think you you sort of always in a little bit of um shocking those moments because you don't it's not never about one individual it's never about me it's always about the team but there was just a lot of thanks from me to the people that that thought of that and then contributed to delivering it and it was a great moment for me personally to have that connection with the city with the supporters to acknowledge that they know that I'm trying for them um and giving my best in the job that that's a really great thing to have we've asked how you how the players have reacted how does your family react to seeing scenes like that in Newcastle because you've talked at length before about how comfortable how settled they are in the city how much they belong in the city they feel how did they react to seeing those scenes on sturday very lowkey which is probably good I don't think they sort of necessarily saw uh and experienced what we saw and experienced I think um they were in another area so I think they're just they're very happy obviously and they're embracing everything but um they're kids you know that they they bring me back down to earth very very quickly in in a number of ways so only in obviously a nice way but you're sort of back to being their dad again and I think for me in this time of my life that's so important to have that um relationship with them there's a famous quote from Kevin Keegan's been doing the rounds of late since the Cup Final that one day Newcastle will have their Club back the fans will have their Club back do you feel like that is now that Newcastle as a city does have their Club back after what's happened over the last fortnite yeah it's very difficult to actually quantify that and sort of give a definitive moment when but I I think it's the the uh the UN the unity is key I think I I'm not going to talk about historically what's gone on at the football club that's not my position to do so but I can talk about since I've been here and I I felt that unity and that's the only chance you have to be successful truly successful is to have the club as one and that's from the top right to the top right to the bottom and that's with the supporters and the players having that relationship where we're helping each other uh not the other way around and I think on the pitch you've seen that teamwork uh work brilliantly and I have to say looking at Wembley again in the isolation the support we had that day definitely made a difference um between players and supporters we helped each other and without a doubt the supporters helped our performance just finally you've talked about kind of where the fans were on Saturday the various different uh different perches that they found you've talked about the passion that they showed how does the team replicate that sort of passion in this first game back at St james' Park tomorrow night against that the fans have showed in the last two weeks yeah I think we got to be careful because obviously the players need to go out in a controlled way as we did at Wembley I think there was a really good balance from the players in sense of we knew it was an important game obviously a very important game but the players just played the what has been natural to them in recent weeks um concentrated on getting the details right and of course played with emotion but not too much emotion and I think that's again absolutely vital against brenford we know it's a big game for us we know there'll be a good feeling at the start of the game but we need to uh control our emotions get the detail right and then you hope with the quality we have it's enough thank you Adam sorry for being late by the way um looking back to the parade what was like your core memory moment where you're like if I'm an old man when I'm an old man that's the moment I'll be looking back and think I'm already an old man um what was the moment uh um I I don't I don't know if there was sort of one I think it was just the sheer number of people I think that every corner we turned you think well it's going to back off in a second and but it didn't if anything it got stronger and stronger so I think it was this year number of people and as I said I think at the time not just the the number it wasn't just people clapping politely it was people really in the moment and really showing their passion for the football club and if anything that's another lesson to us to um respect the positions that we're in and uh work as hard as we can to continue to bring success um your Brazilian players were the life and soul Party by all accounts um J Linton having his own celebration Bruno G being the captain and life of the the locker room um in terms of the Synergy between Brazilian football culture in Newcastle is that a an Avenue that you'll be looking to explore a bit more in the future uh well yeah I think when you look at our our two Brazilian players they've got a lovely um personality um and they enjoyed the win I mean they have a unique way of celebrating um Bruno through singing obviously and everyone got the uh sample of his singing voice which I keep telling him was very strong um and Joey yeah Joey had his own celebrations and and then came back with the group and yeah they both bring a great energy to the squad and you need that so if they're too sort of standard bearers of how uh to conduct yourselves I think they're right up there and just looking towards tomorrow's game um you w need any more motivation given what's happened at the weekend but has it been touched upon that um brenford was probably your toughest lot of the season and looking to um turn turn around that result yeah absolutely I think the players are very aware of that game and the memory of that game still still lives with us to a degree I think um our training's been very consistent um we had a little break after the the final then we got back to work pretty quickly and um I've got no doubt the players will be ready for the game cheers Eddie thanks Adam got to Damian and then Gary hi Eddie um as crazy as it might sound after the last couple of weeks could Champions League qualification arguably be a bigger prize given the financial implications to the club yeah I think um there's no doubting the power of Champions League football um can be game-changing in terms of Revenue and also in terms of what it means and the competition and and then of course the changes that you have to make to be ready for the Champions League football and that that changes everything as we found last year to our cost to some degree um with the extra games and um so yeah there's a lot to think about but I think for us qualifying for that is going to be very very difficult there's as as we know 10 10 games there's a lot of teams competing for those places it's one of the tightest Premier Leagues that we've seen in in recent times very little between those teams competing for those places so it's going to come down to who's the most consistent uh of course we want that to be us and in these 10 games we're going to have to give everything to get there and two seasons we after the final as a as a staff in a squad you regrouped and went on a really good run to to finish where you did can you draw up on that experience this time around yeah well it's interesting you mentioned that because that's not been lost I think the pain of losing the final although it obviously was a big disappointment fired Us in the Premier League so we used that pain to I think win eight out of 10 games which was a brilliant response um and how are we going to respond to success that is a really um different feeling totally different feeling but I think we need the the outcome to be similar it needs to fuel us it needs to help us not hinder us for those things to happen there's going to have to be a a good reaction from the team so um that's probably our big test now thank you go to Gary Ian and then Scott you just touched on it there but after such the emotional high off you know finally achieving that first trophy how how do you ensure that one the eye the tig remains for more silverway and success but also how can your players make sure with the fans still have that thirst and Hunger for More to drive you on yeah I think I certainly think from the players perspective set the the tone if you like and I think consistency for me is hugely important to how we prepare how we train my message my drive I think then the players hopefully will see that nothing's changed um we've won something but ultimately now we still have to improve we still have to grow every day so that would definitely be my message to them um I think for the supporters I think the supporters will understand that that's one moment in isolation but the journey never stops and now our our craving success is even stronger internally it should be um and I think the supporters will back Us in turn and speaking of the supporters backing I think six of the last 10 games are at home but you've lost I think it's three out the last five at home is that something that's concerned you or can you put that down to anything yeah our home form has been a bit scratchy as you say in recent weeks we've um we've had a couple of painful defeats um so yeah I think there's been lessons to learn from those games they've been um tough experiences I think we went through a spell where we weren't defending particularly well I think we've seen a big upt in our last two games West Ham and and Liverpool but the challenge never stops it gets greater brenford will have had you know a long period between their last game they'll be looking at this game ready and obviously they'll have their own thoughts on their season so we need to be ready for the test to come thanks Gary Eddie every man after a big occasion wants to ride the wave as long as possible and avoid anticlimax and clearly you've taken every step that that's the case but is it just about your preparations or is there a psychology involved in it for for sake yeah I think psychology is a huge thing it always is um and you need to to try and identify where your squad's at and what it needs now there will be a a confidence lift for sure after the Liverpool game but that you've got to be careful that it's not it doesn't go into a negative effect for you you've got to try and use it for the positive so I've seen a really good reaction from the players I have to say now of course we split as I said a lot of players went away so we weren't a full group together but the players that stayed worked hard and they were very focused and conducted themselves really well so I haven't seen an overreaction I've seen the type of reaction that I expect from the squad that we have you you were asked a few times before the Cup Final if that was a distraction to uh upcoming League games after the Cup Final can it still be a destruction in another sense um I I get you the question but I I don't think necessarily a distraction now it's just how we react to the moment this is going to be a key moment in our season um of course it can be a negative reaction if we're not careful we have to guard against that but it also can be a huge positive reaction we can Galvanize ourselves and use the positive and as you said earlier go go on the wave of positivity and that that's the Avenue we have to take thanks uh Scott Luke and then Lee hi Eddie um how realistic do you think it is that we'll see Jamal before the end of the season and and how difficult the decision is it going to be with him post the end of the season because I think we've seen in the last few weeks just how big a figure and how popular figure he is within the dressing room and how much he's still a part of that but he's obviously not played football for a long time and and maybe wasn't First Choice before he got injured yeah I think I I don't know whether we see Jamal before the end of season I don't really want to set a Target on his uh time to return I think he is started very light training with the squad but that would be light not not um necessarily in competitive drills but on the drills that are non-competitive he has joined in and he's looked really good um small steps for him we're hoping that we can he can definitely be joining in and um um competing in training before the end of the season whether that ties in with the team whether he gets there in time let's wait and see for competitive action but um he's a big player as you said he's very popular he's still a huge leader in the group um he's got a big presence I'm delighted that he got the chance to lift the cup with the other guys and um he deserved that moment for the length of time that he's been here in the service he's given the club thanks SC Luke right party over time get an questions going um when will you start planning for summer recruitment yeah I think well that's of course that's going on in the background um probably without my um involvement at the moment but that will change uh hopefully in the next few weeks um when you talked about the Bren game I think looking back I think you said there was a bit of soul searching went on can you define what far analis was because that did feel like as you said earlier a really crucial turning point was some were some home truths told uh yeah I think whenever we lose I think there's always we always tried to be very honest in our feedback to the players and the players are very honest with themselves and we knew as a group that that was way below the standards that we expect not so much in the terms of the general performance but the goals we ConEd that day were were really uncharacteristic for us very soft um so I think there was just some Frank honesty between us all and an acknowledgement that we needed to improve I think then we went away and trained really well in the buildup to the Leicester game and uh played really well and then didn't look back really from that moment so I believe in honest constructive feedback to the players and whether that's individually or collectively I think that was more of a a collective reset really is that the big weakness in this team still that it's not quite consistent enough um that you are capable of delivering those sorts of performances brilliant season but we have seen those performances yeah I can't argue with that Luke I think that is the question mark against us I include myself in that that's the question mark against us can we be the team that we were against Liverpool you're not going to be there every game it's impossible to reach that standard but you can still reach a standard and still win the game and that's what we've got to try and do uh we have done it we played West Ham before we played Liverpool we didn't play great but we won the game through defensive steal really and I think it's finding ways to win games when you're not at your best and then hopefully on the days that your performance is where you need it to be um you've got enough quality to win than okay just a few to get through so we can just nud it to a couple of questions maximum each we'll go to Lee Craig and then to Jordan Eddie how do you guard against the sort of euphoria that's been going on in the last couple of weeks in terms of um people getting swept away with the situation yeah well I think it's just the players that I need to try and control and as I said I've not seen anything that suggests they've got carried away the players have acted really really well I think um the training is always the gauge for me if I look at the training and think there's a there's a problem the group's not focused or then I'll I'll make it clear but the groups trained really well I think we had a great training session this week in the buildups the game and there's that steal and there's that Focus that they know the Premier League is a a brutal league if you drop off you'll get punished and we're aware of that just for you personally do you feel it's been a life-changing sort of experience or can you not go down that sort of Avenue you've got to just stick with your principles yeah no I think we always stick with our principles I think it's been it's been an amazing period um I've loved every second of the experience of Wembley whether you with you win or lose is brilliant but it's definitely a better a better moment if you can win there um so yeah that's something I'll never forget I think the the the aftermath of the game Saturday I'll never forget either but now it's very much back to putting that behind us um remembering it but putting it behind us and now focusing on the future thanks L Craig Eddie when you changed the captaincy in on the eve of the Season there was a lot of debate around it and Bruno didn't start the season season in the in the best form yet you've seen his journey through the season and arguably his two best performances of the season with the Cup Final and the post parade party uh do does what you've seen of Bruno in recent weeks is that why you picked him as Captain is that the leadership qualities you you saw yeah I think there's always there's always going to be debate when you're at a club like New Castle when you make decisions but I just think Bruno's really grown into the role I think it's very difficult to suddenly adapt to the captaincy if it's new to you it's a it's a it's a game changer Ian that when I was a player you go from being very selfish thinking of yourself to then having to think of the group and that's a different mindset totally um but I think he's he's really taken on from the experiences that he's had he's now um speaking really well um he's always been a very good role model I'd say he trains very well he's the ultimate professional he he doesn't drink he's he's football obsessed and I think the other players see that so I think we have some really good leaders I I always said this and when I made the decision you're not necessarily focusing on one leader of the group like we mentioned Jamal earlier still a brilliant leader although he's not fit um Dan burn is an outstanding leader in many different ways doesn't wear the armband but he leads Kieran um has been C this season as well and is an outstanding leader in his own right and that's why we've been able to win the competition that we have because we don't just have one guy that's doing it all and tell us the truth what did you think of the Sandro tar song when Bruno started it and did you have to explain the lyrics to your your boys afterwards I'm still trying to understand the lyrics myself so I'll leave it at that I think great nothing from Jord go to Dominic um historically you've ended the season very strong after the trip to Dubai but in terms of team bonding possibly no better sort of situation than Saturday to Galvanize your squad heading into the final 10 games yeah I think the team spirit and feeling within the group's always been good um this season we the group has been yeah we've got some great characters in there the the players get on but also they've got an edge where they will tell each other if they're not happy and they're very competitive against each other as well so which is what you need in training and the training grounds so I've had no problem with the spirit of the group um yeah moments like Dubai can can help that I think the players are very active very you know doing different sports earlier in the week um but remember it was a small group you know eight nine players that's all we had um but now we're back together uh we're focused on the next match you touched on Jamal the cell's contract situation earlier but Fabian CH another play out a contract in the summer is there any update on his situation I think Fabby hopefully will be signing his contract imminently um if he hasn't already to my knowledge thanks St uh couple to finish we'll go Kieran and then Martin morning uh do you get the sense that the past couple of weeks have given the owners a taste for more maybe difficult to to comment really um because I haven't had sort of direct com contact with the owners since um since the cut final obviously that night um after the final we did but things move on they're very busy people so um I'm sure that they would have seen things through maybe a slightly different lens um and obviously seeing the reaction of everybody at Newcastle they will of No Doubt um seen that and um we'll be hoping for more and what what can wi something do for the club well I think it could just changes beliefs I think it shows what is capable um I think that's important for us that we we believe and I've never not had that belief sometimes people need to see it to believe it um but yeah but the the competition gets harder and harder as we know and nothing gets easier so um our work has to be better and I think that's all I can focus on Martin's finish please morning Eddie Nick Nick Pope was a big call for the cup final but it's kind of gone under the radar that he did very very well do you sense a determination from him to reestablish himself as number one from this point yeah I do I think Nick had a a difficult season with injury um and it's like any player coming back from injury there's always a uh depending on the situation and the length of time out there's a period of rustiness when they come back and I think um I think we saw Nick in his best form the last two games West Ham and Liverpool I thought he played really really well and he had to because there was big moments in those games where we needed him and he responded I have to say since the cut final he's also trained outstandingly well he's he's looked in really good shape so fingers crossed um he's over his injury problems and he can stay fit and continue to play well and there's a lot of talk um potentially about signing another goalkeeper does he remain your kind of your number one and does he still have international Ambitions um at this stage in his career I'm sure he does I mean I I I haven't necessarily had those conversations at length with him it's been about regaining his best form and and yeah training everything that goes into delivering your best form we we've really tried to focus on that with him but I'm sure he'll have his own individual aims and Ambitions and and why not for me he's an out outstanding shot stopper um and he showed that against Liverpool with his save from Curtis Jones"
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,mr6j8mfLqas,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr6j8mfLqas,Alex Bruno nice to see you how you how you feeling ahead of Sunday go first yeah feeling good feeling good uh feeling is a good opportunity for ourselves uh be honest we cannot wait to get there everyone is very excited um as a team as a city I think uh we have been working very hard since we are together here a big opportunity uh and hopeful everything going to be good and we can finally uh get this trophy back to Newcastle you you you mentioned there about being excited um when we heard you on on Monday after after West Ham you were saying look this is this is our Cup Final and our World Cup final should have saying and obviously it is but how important is it that as players you don't get too excited of course I think we're more relx than the fans of course but we know exactly what mean to them it's a long time uh for always we have been together for three years and we have seen this opportunity uh as a big one but for the point of the view about the fs we know for them and a World Cup final because it's a long long time and uh we want to make everyone the city happy ourselves is we have our targets as well so going to be a good game with two teams uh we have to play our game nothing different and hopefully everything going to be good for us if you if you don't mind casting your your mind back two years ago to the the final if you can think back to that what would you as a player or as a team what would you have done done differently it's tough to say now uh I think it's another moment uh sometimes when you lose you don't remember many many things about the game but I think now we have more confidence we have different players uh so what what I can say is our confidence is very high at the moment because you know it's a good opportunity to always make history together Alex and another thing that Bruno said on uh on Monday night after the game was that in yourself we've got the best striker in the world at the moment that must must have been nice to hear yeah I didn't actually hear that said it very quickly that's nice nice to hear though yeah of course of course that's nice yeah and how how are you feeling ahead of ahead of Sunday because obviously you've had a couple of injury concerns recently and it feels like you're kind of fighting your way back how is your level of Fitness um no I feel good um it's probably been um put out a bit more dramatic uh than it been uh I haven't been injured I've just uh just had a little bit of tightness which which can be normal uh when you play a lot of games uh but yeah I feel good and uh and really excited for the game so what is your what is your sort of training regime been like this week what have you done to try and ensure that you're at you're 100% best come come Sunday nothing uh um um I think the best way to prepare is to to train us normal um be a part of the team and uh yeah just uh train every day um like you're fully fit which which I am and when you when you look at who you face in the final Liverpool obviously they had a you know a big night the other night against Paris sanch exited the the champions league is there any chance that that could have an effect on on on them come Sunday do you feel um yeah I think I think every game will affect you in some way um but yeah we can't really know or or speculate too much about if it's if it's going to be positive or negative it might as well be a positive reaction for them so I think uh um it will come down to what we do as a team um that's that's what we have to focus on and that's what's going to be the difference finally for me Bruno when you get in the cut final haircut no no not this time not at all no no no not this time you just come with the yeah no more one no more one let's see this time if I get more lucky is that your decision or the manager no my decision goodish Bruno today there are schools and nurseries across the city they've got black and white Day Children going in their Newcastle kits rather than their uniforms tens of thousands fans traveling to London watching in Newcastle what what's your message to them ahead of Sunday wow this is good a good opportunity like I said uh we are feeling the same than them we just want to make thousand to Thousand Js happy uh we know football sometimes can affect you in every way but my message is stay positive we're going to do our best to get uh to get this trle back to the city how do you feel the team has changed and evolved from two years ago like I said before I feel always more confidence of course when we made a final before you get more experience as a team uh of course we change some players but the base is still there uh feeling confidence I think we are in a in a in a best moment than we were the last time we Face menu uh in the final so very confidence positive uh hopeful we can go there play our best football because in in our best day I think we are really a great team thank you you Alex we've talked so many times with your manager Eddie how about your fantastic form this season the last final you actually were on the bench to start but since then your captain has referred to you as possibly the best player in the world you've been talked as one of the best players have not the best striker in Europe currently what's been the key to how much you've improved since then um I think um hard work training um and the the mentality to uh wanting to get better uh which which I I have um I have Ambitions High Ambitions to to achieve things uh in my career and be the best version of myself uh and then yeah I have teammates that uh help me get better uh many players that have been here uh since since I came uh and I think yeah with with the time uh you just get better connections and uh I think you all just benefit each other uh better and better thank you good luck thank you Bruno what's it like to play against Liverpool good game top things uh I think my opinion nowadays the best thing in the world they are proven this in the Premier League winning by 15 points uh but be honest I would always prefer to play with good teams because uh they play and we have pass to play as well so we have to be focused uh we sometimes we don't have too much about them and think about what we can do as a team to superise them and play our best football and Alex just you spoke to Bruno about about the history and the excitement what does that mean to you the fact that Newcastle haven't won a trophy for so long um by it means um obviously I didn't I don't wish that it was that way but um it it means a lot that we have the the a chance to to change that um as I said I think we have to um just be focused about the game and not uh let the fact that the club hasn't won anything in a long time um get to us too much um I understand the excitement uh around the city and uh yeah around the whole club but um yeah personally uh I just feel focused and uh quite relaxed uh for the game and um obviously excited but but yeah focused on on the job thank you we got Damian Lee and then Ian please hi Alex how were were you when you joined the club of the bigname strikers who had been here in the past the Jackie milb burs wel McDonald Allen shearers and how does it feel now to be compared to those players um how well aware I was I didn't have too much knowledge uh but my football knowledge in General is pretty bad uh true no but obviously Alan Sher um Pap de that's kind of where it stops my knowledge um but yeah um I think you you found out quite quick uh about the grades and about the history of the club and um yeah I'm I'm trying to create my own history um and uh yeah I'm happy with we what I've done so far but um I'm always just looking forward and and Bruno given what you've experienced in your time at the club how surprised are you that it's 70 years since this club won a domestic trophy yeah like I said I did not wish them uh to go through this moment but we are seeing this as a big opportunity uh to make a history after a long time uh so at the moment we are just seeing this is opportunity you know uh like I said we want to make a history we know they're excited about the fans but we try to not get Focus now about what the f is thinking because sometimes we cannot think too much about this time we just want to be focus on the job go there play our best game and after if everything was right celebrate with them going to be good thank you good luck Alex do you think when you talk about your Ambitions do you think you're can achieve all those Ambitions at this football club I mean that's that's why I came here um I've I've said many times I don't really look too much or think too much uh about my future uh but yeah I've said I'm I'm happy here and and we are contenders for for titles uh which is which is what you want to um win as a football player uh we've been in a final and now we're we're in another one uh so I think uh the chances are there you went up the goal scoring list you You' only got Alan sheir ahead of you I think one day you could catch Alan she at the top of that list I think that's uh tough huh yeah that's bit disrespectful towards him too and talk about that uh because that's so far um no I'm I think uh I think my my goal scoring record um has has been good uh so far um but as I said uh I'm not really looking too far uh forward um I just stay in moment and that's that's the best way for me to keep keep my form and uh keep keep scoring thank a question for both players it's perhaps a little bit unfair to Alex after what he recently said if I said the names Vic Keel and George Hanah to you would you know who they were no no they they they scored the last time Newcastle won a major honors 70 years ago how does it feel your names in 70 years time will still be talked about in the way that their names are today that's tough to answer now to think 70 years is too much but of course when you're going to see the club history everything you're going to find this name there and of course when you see here after 70 you want to be there as well so for me I'm I'm not thinking about schore I'm just think to play well and doing the trophy you know but yeah it's nice to know some people who made the history for this club I'm talking Club Legends Alex is Alan Shiva been in touch with you personally Bob moner the last player to lift the trophy Bruno he been in touch I was spoke with h I think was the the last player who score uh in Wembley for Newcastle so I I thought his his fit to give me a little bit of ly yeah and hopeful I can do the same there uh yeah but it was a good time thanks Ian we'll go Martin Gary and then Mark please hi Alex what can this football club achieve and does the speculation about your future unsettle you at all um I think this club can achieve uh great things um I think you should really look at one season at a time and and this season yeah we can achieve uh winning a trophy uh which would be which would be amazing for for everyone um and uh yeah really about my future is nothing really I think about um I've said many times like during the season I just focus on a job and um now is probably the worst time to even think about anything else uh so um all of our focus is is just on on Sunday um and yeah doing good and hopefully uh bringing the trophy back to Newcastle thank you and and Bruno have you visualized walking the stairs at Wembley and lifting the trophy on Sunday many times I think probably since we get final I have been thinking this a lot but like I said I don't want to get too excited about it focus on the game first and when you get there going to be wow very good very good um but yeah of course I I imagine me there in this in this place morning uh just a quick question to you Alex every time you got on the pitch you look like you don't Fe it anybody no matter who you come up against obviously you're up against Virg van DJ who many consider the best defender in the world is it fair to say you are fearless every time you go out there on the on the pitch um yeah I I wouldn't say a fear anyone I think that's a that's a strong word um I have a lot of respect for uh for the players I come up against have a lot of respect for van djk and and their whole defense um but yeah I I'm I'm a player who always just focus on on myself um if if I do the right things if I play my best game then um yeah I think I'll benefit my team uh but yeah it's it's not really a jewel uh me against one player I think it's Newcastle against Liverpool and uh if we play together obviously Ana uh my teammates as well to to help me get better uh it's it's a team it's a team sport so uh it comes down to what we do as a team and I'll obviously try to use my qualities to make us better thank you Mark Alex I know you mentioned about your future there the have said they quite open contract talks with the summer is that something you'd be open to you think they said you want to too much forward but that that something be open to yeah yeah I think um as I've said I not really thinking about the summer um but yeah that'll probably probably be a talking point uh once The Season's finished which um yeah we will really see cuz no talks has been held yet Bruno your your tears at the end of the last final a lot of people remember was that something that you kind of like used to motivate you this time as well and you're hoping you totally different obviously yeah one a te of Happ this time you know uh everyone knows how emotional I am I always try to give everything that I have in the pitch uh to play as a fun uh because I know what means for them so yeah always I still remember this moment like I said at this time I want to uh cry off happiness and hopefully hopeful everything going to be going to be good for us on the day thank you just have a couple of minutes left so if we could do one question each from Craig Luke Dom and Scott please thank you Alex we call you the best striker in the world your teammates call you the best best striker in the world no one's ever asked you are you the best striker in the world um no I can't I can't really answer that um I think I'm enjoying my football uh I'm enjoying where I'm at um I would never really put um that tag on myself um I think that's for others to judge but but yeah I'm certainly happy with where I'm at in in my career right now Alexander um you talked there about wanting to achieve things in the game is one of those things having a defining impact on a game of this magnitude scoring goals on this sort of platform to prove that you are that worldclass player um yeah of course uh I think as a striker you you have to have that mindset uh not just because it's a final but I think that's the general mindset you have in the game uh leading leading the line and being that threet and finishing off attack so um I think we all in all positions have our way to have a big impact uh on on a game like this it's not just about scoring uh it's also about defending uh as a midfielder he does pretty much everything on the field so um it's not just uh scoring the goals um even if that's probably the biggest talking point of the game we got dman Scotts please morning Alex just on Liverpool you touched on them before but you made your debut at anfield you scored your first goal for Newcastle against Liverpool scored against them early on the season how do you feel when you come up against this team who as Bruno said possibly the best team in the world at the moment um I really enjoy uh the games against Liverpool because I think they're um not too different to ourselves um it's like a high pressing team and direct team um which can lead to to many counter opportunities and that's that's the game I like uh so yeah um I think I've had pretty good success before and uh U yeah I feel feel good and enjoy playing against them Alex we've heard a lot of what Bruno has had to say about you so let's flip the tables what would you say about Bruno in terms of the way you've seen his game develop during your time as a Newcastle player but also how he's taken to being Captain this year and what you feel he's offered the whole Squad as a captain in the lead good [Music] question it's it's not if he says yeah he's rubbish um no really I think uh I think he was an amazing player even when I signed uh but yeah he's he's taking steps uh as a player and also as a leader you can see on the pitch he's um the games he he controls uh the game he we usually win and we usually play a good game so he's uh really the heart of the team and it's really nice also to see him play as a eight uh because then he's closer to me as well on the field um yeah and I really have high demands on Bruno on the pitch I always tell him to pass me the ball all the time in difficult situations and that's because uh I rate him really highly so um yeah I think his potential is really really high I love to play with him and yeah as a captain uh I think his his passion uh for the club and and yeah for the football is probably something everyone can see but but yeah it's uh it's contagious and um gives us also energy on the field and and I think he's done really well
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,KP6c449D_yw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP6c449D_yw,Eddie nice to see you um firstly before we get into the Cup Final we just have some breaking news in the last moment that Dan burn has received his first call up to the the England squad by Thomas tuer what a moment for him what a moment for the football club yeah incredible moment for Dan and I have to say there's no one more deserving in my opinion um starting to work with Dan um when we did and came in obviously during our relegation battle just such an inspiring guy but also a very talented player and I think it's a great story really one of the great football stories one of the great comebacks someone who had to do it the real hard way um coming through the leagues uh dedicated professional a leader a real man um an inspirational figure just two days ago I was actually out at his um his former youth club BL BL Spartans who he came through from the age of five and his coach back then said they never thought he would ever ever make it to to sort of even sort of League one League 2 level but to come all the way through the the gears right up to the Premier League now receiving an England s call up at the age of of 32 and you touched on it there it is remarkable how much of that is due to his character and personality and determination to just keep going I probably say 99% of it because he's he is the model Pro really um he's so committed to what he does and I think he's had to be I mean he's he's been given great strengths his his size and his height they're brilliant weapons to have on a football pitch especially as a center half but then you've got to um improve all the other areas of your game to sort of um see that as a big strength and he's done that for me and um his his character is so stable so level that he takes every Challenge and every potential negative um in his stride and comes back stronger and um I'm so pleased for him on a personal level because he's he's thoroughly deserved it have you had a chance to see him this morning since very briefly he told us about the call up so very briefly just before coming here so no no time to celebrate with him straight into this room no dancing from him not yet still time I suppose it's a strange one wa in a way I know obviously you won't want to be thinking beyond Sunday at this point but obviously if you do lift the cup he'll be straight off to to meet up with his his New England teammates it's a different Dynamic for him not celebrating with the friends and family sh should you win of course yeah I think that's a difficult one for anyone to to go to mentally but I just think it is separate from the cut final this is just a great moment for Dan and of course for for Newcastle um but the cut final is uh of course all we're thinking about right now so on the cup final um how are how are you feeling how are the the squad feeling how different at all does it feel to to two years ago feeling very good thanks I think um it does feel it does feel different I think the whole thing this season's felt different in the sense that I think we've just gone about our business in a really calm controlled way way professional way we've had a really tough run of fixtures in the carabel cup and I think to attack those games in the way that we did and of course you're in the midst of a a busy campaign Premier League FA Cup we've sort of just gone from round to round and now we've ended up in the final but there's been a lot less emotion there's been a lot less noise I think out outside of sort of in here um and hopefully that helps us in our performance in the game you you never quite know what effect that will have but we've been uh very much focused on our buildup and preparation and getting the game plan right um yeah so I'd say that's the biggest difference it felt very much like you needed a a bit of a bounce a bit of momentum to go into the final with it it feels like you got that after the performance on Monday against West Ham but a real team effort and I think you could probably see by the celebrations at the end that it was a a real big thing to give you guys a lift going into Sunday yeah we needed it we really did we needed a confidence boost a confidence lift from somewhere and I think the only thing that could give us that was winning that game so we knew in our preparation for the game how big it was we had a long time to prepare for that game after Brighton so very pleased with the execution it wasn't pretty but it was just what we needed and I think the scenes at the end I think the players knew that as well we all knew that so um this week's been yeah a good week in preparing for the game and I just want to ask you one more if you don't mind about the fans because Bruno made a a good point I felt after the match on on Monday night in his in his interview when he said um look we're away from St james' Park but it's 50/50 there's 50% Newcastle fans 50% Liverpool fans and we know how loud the Newcastle fans can be is that something you need to take into your mind that this isn't a away game this isn't a neutral venue and the Newcastle fans in many ways can be that 12th man for you yeah I'm sure they will be for us I think they always are they were at West Ham um we know from last the last time we got to the final that scenes Drive up to Wembley the the feeling of support and unity that we had the expression the fans give in every game is is huge for us and yeah we're going to need them we're absolutely going to need that 50% to turn it into 55 if possible um we need every bit of help we can to push us over the line that's thanks Nisha hi Eddie what do you think is the biggest lesson that you learned from two years ago and how have you evolved as a head coach since then difficult to say I think for me my own personal perspective because you go from game to game and you're just trying to do your best I'm sure I have changed and evolved in ways that maybe I don't even realize following that cut final we've gone into the Champions League we've had a lot more Premier League experience so I think we're maybe uh become more accustomed to the bigger games that's been part of what we've done since we've been here so I think hopefully um um we're robust enough to deal with any challenge that's thrown in front of us um yeah I'd say that's probably the biggest change maybe that big game experience hopefully that will help us when we need it there'll be times where a team almost selects itself but H how difficult is your team selection been for this game on Sunday genuinely whenever I look at The A Team selection for for any game there's always decisions to make um that'll be no different for this game because you're always looking at the position in your own strengths and trying to figure out what players need to go up against certain players so that's that's what we've done we don't have a huge pool of players to select from that that's pretty obvious we have a very tight Squad um and in some sense is that can help you in in different moments and that can also be a negative um but I think we're in a good place after the win on Monday night that was the key thing and all the players are feeling a lot more confident have you talked about that feeling when when you lost against Manchester United to kind of use it as even more motivation for Sunday no we've not gone back to that game at all really I think it's it's pretty much irrelevant the occasion yes but the game itself and the feelings and emotions the players don't need reminding of how that feeling of losing you know how painful that is but after a game like that and how long that lives with you and it's still still with us to a degree so no we've just focused on this game and where we are we're a different team we've got different players um we're very much positive we're going in with a positive mindset we're going to try and be very much ourselves and um give a good expression of what we do and just finally is there any injury updates following that West Ham game uh yeah of course the the long term are the long term now so Lewis Hall recovering after his operation Sven recovering after his operation Jamal still making uh progress to come back Anthony suspended apart from that we hope to have full Squad thank you thanks Nisha Simon good morning Eddie morning I'm sure everybody in this room in the past couple of weeks has written a piece about newcastle's long history without winning a trophy what does that mean to you um it's a difficult one because I I think A lot's made of that and of course I understand why but I think it's a real motivation for us to to try and break that that long time and that long wait that everyone's feeling here um it's should be inspiring for us not not a negative and I know understand it will be a negative or perceived negative for a lot of people but we're trying to look at it the other way around uh chance to make history for us um as a team that that's very rare in football you get very few opportunities to do that chance to be remembered uh positively which again is not very many uh times in your career you get a chance to do that so I think they're all positive outcomes and I want the players to look at it that way um as I said earlier to attack the game and to give a good representation of us we all know how good Liverpool are obviously you will have watched the game the other night do you think that the fact that went so deep has any bearing on Sunday's game and generally you know what are your thoughts about how you try and unpick this Liverpool team um I don't think the extra time has anything to do with this game I think there's a long enough recovery time for them to be back to normal so um I thought it was a great game great advert for the Champions League I thought it was um two really good teams going against each other I was entertained while watching the game and of course I'm looking at it from a tactical perspective and an analytical perspective trying to find um ways that we think we can win very very few coming through because they're so strong but we always believe that we have an angle and we always believe that we have the players that can make a difference against any any system or any team so I've got total faith and belief in the players okay written guys we'll get in as many questions as we can in the time we'll start with Daman Spellman we'll go the we tail and then Lee Ryder EDD there's been a lot written and said about the players you won't have available but you as both a player and a manager have dealt with adversity throughout your career do you sense that same bloody mindedness in your your players yeah I think you have to I I think you have to come together stronger so in in the week that we had that certainly didn't go as planned when we had players losing big players as well and important players never easy but you have to regroup and then you have to come back stronger and yeah you have to come back stronger in a more unified way that's always the key aspect it's how you respond to it um we tried to double down on our core strengths um that doesn't change regarding on individuals available um and I think the spirit's been really good and it'll be that's why West Ham was so important and it wasn't lost on any of us after the game that but that increased our feeling that increased our our Unity that increased our um belief internally we needed that win um training's been good this week the preparation's been very good I've been happy with how everything's looking to this point we're still two days left to go um so yeah everything's positive now thank you Louise hi Eddie um I think Mo Salah has scored 13 goals in 14 appearances against your teams Bournemouth and Newcastle bril um so it's really two questions how how do you stop him and B have you had any conversations with Salah after after games I didn't know that uh so thanks for that one uh no no conversations with with Salah I really respect him as a footballer of course um but I don't tend to indulge in too many conversations with opposing players for me it's about my players and making sure I speak to them um stopping him is a different is a different train of thought totally but so I think we will have our plan we always do have a plan against um different opponents executing that to the best of our ability will be the key and it's always about the team so whenever there's an outstanding individual and Liverpool have a few in different positions um um attacking playerwise and I think it's always about the team and making sure our structures are good not about any individuals of course the individuals around that area have to play very well too thanks Louise Lee Ryder Edie how long will you leave it before you tell the goalkeepers who's going to be in and who's on the bench everyone will find out at the at the same time when I name the team um when that will be I'll leave that to uh to myself not to you guys um I think the uh Team selection for for these types of games is always difficult because there' be players that are disappointed um naturally everyone wants to play in the bigger games so um I could only pick 11 you talk about the disappointment but even if they are disappointed they could still have a role later in the game and that I guess that even includes a goalkeepers we've seen Keepers bought on for penalty shootouts in the past everyone has a role um and if you're not starting the game Your Role is to support the players that are playing and that's just as important as stepping out onto the pitch because if you don't support your teammates well enough that can have a big negative effect on the group so personal disappointment I understand but then you have to put it behind you and and think of the team and the club thanks Lee uh Luke Edwards Mark Douglas and then Ian M please um you've been Newcastle manager long enough now you've heard talk of curses um which might have been something to do with me but um what is your message to the supporters who are conditioned conditioned for disappointment that have have been to this will be the sixth final they've been in and they've lost the previous five what is your message to them and dispense him with that kind of negativity um yeah I I don't I don't subscribe to that way of thinking really I think for me that there isn't always a negative outcome I understand the final record that you you mentioned there isn't great but I take for examples like qualifying for the Champions League we had to go deep into the season um and it was nip and Tuck as to whether we're going to qualify we did we got over the line so I think there's there's examples where we have we have been really successful even getting to the finals isn't a given as we've seen in the FA Cup they're very very difficult to get through and qualify so of course now we're there we just want to play to our true maximum capabilities which we felt against Manchester United the last time we got there was an okay performance but okay is not good enough it's not going to win your trophies so the the destiny is in our own hands it's not in any I'm not even going to use the word that you mentioned but it's it's not in those um or that mindset really it's about just us delivering a great performance if we can and of course then talking about the other outcome and the other possibilities that exist that's exciting that that's what we're here for so I don't really have a general message on it but that's the way I think thanks Luke Mark Ed you mentioned about taking emotion out of it but will you kind of remind the players how much it means to the city and what a big occasion it is or do you sort of keep that out of it and very much approach it has and another game yeah I don't say taking emotion out of it but I think controlling it is the key you need emotion you need you need to feel all the excitement the potential wh ifs from the from the positive side but you just need to control it if you're too emotional you won't perform at your best if you're under stimulated which I'd be very surprised if anyone was of course you won't perform at your best so it's getting that sweet spot it's getting that balance absolutely right and that's what we try to do in our preparation think we've got a lot of experienced players I think that has to be mentioned players that played for their countries Champions League games won big competitions not worried about us on that side so um I think that's the key things id M morning Eddie morning uh you mentioned that the F very different than two years ago the fact that you didn't have a media day earlier this week you're holding your press conference on the traditional day suggests you're preparing in a way like a league game not as a special occasion would that be fair I think that would be fair and I think I made this point after West Ham I think if we're changing our preparation for the team drastically for this one game then there's a problem with how we prepare normally so that that that's sort of my way of thinking it should be every game's a cut final really every Premier League game they're so big that we want to perform to our best so we want to keep it very very stable for the players so it's not anything too new um to give them the best chance of performing in the way that we normally perform Ian sorry I'm going to have to move because just for time I've got a Chris W um to Scott and then to Jordan please more Eddie um Javy Barnes during his time in the castle has had a lot of injury setbacks he hasn't necessarily made that left wing position his own but he obviously comes in for Anthony the other day gets an assist how big an opportunity is this for for him to show why you signed him and his qualities on the biggest stage yeah it's a great opportunity potentially for Harvey I think a you did really well against West Ham because that's not an easy game for him to come in um really pleased with his cross for the goal I thought it was an outstanding um piece of technical delivery really floated the ball in Bruno applied the Finishing Touch he's done that he consistently when he's played for us he's very much a um a producer of big moments goals assists uh which you want all your attacking players to have the capability of of delivering he's got that X Factor um he's been competing with a very good player for the same position although we have used Harvey off the right quite a lot when he's been fit um sort of the middle end of the season um yeah I'm hopeful if selected Harvey would give a good performance Scott hi Eddie um I know you said you think this team's a bit different with more control and everything but when you've had success against big teams particularly Liverpool in the past it's tended to be real intensity real real aggression knock them out the stride kind of like and jameses this season you haven't really been able to do that to them at anfield can you play like that in a Wembley final that that that style I think we can play it a number of styles I I don't think we're limited I think we've done it in different ways against the uh the bigger teams this year I think we've been competitive in the main probably Manchester City apart I think we've been competitive in every other game um even the Liverpool game recently was yes it was a 2-n defeat but I thought we were well in the game ConEd some poor goals our style we do have adaptability but also we have a a clear um method of how we want to play clear principles we don't deviate from them although we can tweak things so um yeah I think the clear representation of us both in and out of possession will be absolutely vital for us this weekend thanks Scott we've got the Jordan crawling Craig H and Martin Hardy please hi you just looking at Liverpool's left hand side how important will Joel Linton be given the the absence of Anthony and Lewis yeah I've been really pleased with his return actually the the two games that he's played I thought the Brighton game he did really well um from a physical perspective he looked himself which is a big challenge after the type of injury that he had and the length of time had been out and then back that up against West Ham with 90 minutes full of action full of jol's big asset covering ground tackling disrupting play um and of course he's got a lot of quality as well with the ball and we miss him when he's not there I think we miss his um his strength so yeah but of course he's a weapon for us in lots of different ways um potentially defensively on that side yes I get the question but of course the other way as well and he's such an important player for us attacking um he can pop up with a a goal when we needed so hopefully plays a big game thanks Jordan Craig m n you said one of the keys will be keeping things the same to that end will you wear a suit when you lead out Newcastle and just take us inside that moment what it will what it'll mean to you um I've not really given that to be honest too much consideration I think uh my attire will be very consistent with what you normally see and that's not meant to be I'm very respectful of traditions and um what it means to be in that position as Newcastle manager but I just think I'm better off focusing on the game rather than my um my attire as I said said um it means everything I said when I came to the club so proud to be here so proud to represent the city and I want to do it in the right way and try and make everybody proud and happy and that that's obviously the challenge that we have this weekend okay Martin Hardy morning Eddie can you put into words how great your desire is to win something and at what point did the pain of 2023 start to fire you up to want to get back to Wembley straight away really Martin I think I remember the the night after sorry the the night of the the final I was not in a not in a great place you know not not too happy um straight you know went to spend the night with my kids because I think they take you away from because you can just live in that re rethinking the game rethinking everything that you've done so um they they take you in a much better healthier place so hopefully I'm not in that mindset again this weekend but I think yeah straight away because you have to then go right let's get back to work what could we have improved what could we have done better what you know what can we do to have success in the future and a lot of that invariably comes down to recruitment so towards the end of that season we're then looking at what players we need for the new one and um there's always hope there's always another game so that's how I look at it sorry and how great is that desire of yours to win a trophy well it couldn't be it couldn't be greater um and I think you can you can talk uh a good game but I think it's and how you act every day and it's how you try and push the team to new levels so yeah I feel as motivated as I've ever been okay time for one more Dominic SC morning Eddie three center backs work for your so well against Arsenal in the semi-final with Sven botman out injad is that still a effective option for you to consider on Sunday it's still a potential option yes um we we are running out of Defenders to a degree um which makes it a bit more difficult of course but uh I wouldn't rule anything out that's why I said earlier we do have way of playing but we're very free in terms of tactical setup so we can of course change system but the principles of our play would remain untouched
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,-VTFEhXlJNY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VTFEhXlJNY,hi Eddie good morning um can we start with Lewis Hall please obviously such a big blow for you and the player to lose him for the the remainder of the Season just your reaction to that news yeah really disappointed for Lewis um devastated for him actually because he had so much to look forward to um at this moment of the season with obviously the cut final will be a big thing for all the players at the moment but leis had also International um um possible International experience um coming up and he was just in really good form as well and playing very well so yeah that's a big blow for him for us most important thing now is his recovery and making sure he comes back as good as he's been did he sustain the injury at Liverpool last week or was it a training ground problem no no it was um it was from the game but I don't necessarily think it was in that game I think it was there was a slight buildup um on speaking to leis afterwards and trying to find out the sort of the timeline of the injury but that was the game where I think the feeling in his ankle had just got to the point where it needed investigating um he played very well in the game but he just had a bit of stiffness and swelling afterwards so we investigated and obviously it's landed to this point and for any player to know that they're going to be out for a period of time must be difficult the exact timing of this must make it doubly hard for him how do you feel he is emotionally after this news yeah I think initially I think with with like with any player in this moment he would have taken that quite um quite emotionally and you expect that because there's so much at stake and Lewis along with the rest of the players here have given everything to try and get to this moment and um obviously win win a trophy for the football club so that was the aim and that was in his head unfortunately that was taken away from him at quite a dramatic late moment um but I think now I think he's in a much better place because once you have a few days to to take in the information and then you know what's going to happen I think as soon as he's going to obviously have an operation as soon as you have that then I think your your mind's in a totally different place and what's the situation right now as it stands with Sven botman and his knee injury so with Sven we've been trying to get him back to full fitness and he was actually very close for the Brighton game um just the day before one of the last actions in training he felt the same problem in his knee so that meant again just a sort of a resetting and we still hoped he could come back but then this week again he's he's felt the same discomfort so looks like he and now have to have an operation I think you've told us previously that the opposite knee to the one that he had the two ACL injuries in last season what is the nature of this problem this has come actually from a from a knock in one of his first games back um and again he didn't feel it was a a big issue um but I think there's without going to two technically just needs a a real small operation just to clear out some fluid and then he'd be fine again it feels like this week in particular with the disappointment of losing to Brighton losing Anthony Gordon to suspension and these two injuries that probably hasn't been a lot of good news around how challenging has it been for you this week it's not been the best of weeks is it I think um it's been uh one of those weeks that that challenges you in in the job that I'm in but I think you always need a level head you need clear thinking and you need to put it always into perspective we still have a very strong Squad we still have a very strong team we're going to miss the players that that we're going to lose and that's a big disappointment but it's always someone else's opportunity and we have to look at it that way and those players I know will be supporting us and and hoping we can do really well and last question from me just about West Ham away on Monday they've had some good results recently under gry and Potter so um they're also a team that beat you under their previous manager earlier in the season in isolation this game given your situation how the table looks how big is Monday night but also how big an opportunity could it be yeah I mean it's a huge game for us and I think that can't be lost we can't get distracted we can't lose the the focus on the Premier League and I know um all the talk will be of the game ahead um after West Ham but for me the focus this week's been very good from the players I've been really pleased despite the sort of outside noise going on with the players that we've already discussed um I see a determination to try and do well in the game um West Ham always a tough place to go to Graham always a difficult manager to prepare teams against so yeah we're looking forward to the challenge thanks r p Eddie good morning um Anthony Gordon's red card obviously has left you another body down why no decision to appeal that well I think it's always a a discussion point and we discussed it as a club um with the respective people that we need to discuss it with lawyers Etc and we just felt that there probably wasn't sufficient grounds to do that how frustrating has he found all that the the player Anthony about no about about no appeal because again that would have given him maybe a chance to play on yeah but I think yeah have to look at it in isolation you have to review the incident there was no intention from Anthony you didn't mean to um without going into too much detail on the actual event itself I think the player sort of bends down it makes it the sort of push look worse there was no intention from Anthony to to hurt anybody but you have to look at it and go is this does this have a chance of being successful if there's no chance of being successful what's the point of appealing so um Anthony understands that and I don't want this to sound like a medical bulletin but I mean tripa esack I mean they've they've also been mentioned mentioned this week as as either coming back from injury or having little niggles how are they and is is anybody else having problems no um we still got two more training sessions before Monday night's game but at the moment that would be enough um and fingers crossed we can keep everyone else fit and in terms of of I know what you say about the the West Ham game being the focus but I mean and that's always the important game the next one but I mean surely at the back of your mind you have to start thinking about the Cup Final don't you and who who may be to rest who may be to protect no I don't think so no that the the focus is on West Ham it's a Premier League game our Premier League form is hugely important to us we need to get back on track in that respect we need to feel the momentum of winning and the best chance we have of winning any cup is to go into the game that game feeling as good as we can and the only way to feel good is to win so we will pick our strongest team um resting players doesn't even come into my head I mean if you think not a player not playing for two weeks before a huge game is good for them that's not the case they need regular football um to give them the best chance of being fit but also performing so those players uh as I say will play and as you say a difficult week in terms of the injuries and the build up to two big games easy to feel sorry for yourself easy for the players to feel sorry for themselves how how determined have you been that that's not the case no we're not feeling sorry for ourselves at all it's part of the game if you actually look at it in isolation we've got three injured players in our Squad um that includes Jamal ourselves Sven bman Lewis Hall and we've got one player suspended that's by any team in the Premier League that's not huge numbers the the challenge we have is we have a very small Squad as we've said um all season um our job now is to make the players that we do have fit and available feel as good as they can so we can start winning again thank you thank you and on Eddie you touched on it with Razer can you remember in your managerial career a worse week in terms of Lu bad luck because it just seemed like every single morning there was something else I'm probably uh I probably had worse weeks in luck um I just can't recall them as we stand here now I think I think the the difficulty is when the news came out it sort of came out day after day and it it made it look worse but of course behind the scenes we've been dealing with Lewis's injury for a while um Sven sven's picture has always been slightly unclear we hoped he would come back but it's been unclear obviously Anthony's red card was was purely on Sunday so we have a little bit more time than everybody else to digest the news um but I understand for everyone on the outside that would come as some big big blows this week just on Sven do you hope to see him back before the end of the season yeah I think we should do I think the whenever you have a it's a really minor operation but when whenever you have an operation there's always a slight unknown but we hope he'll be back sort of8 weeks is the timeline so that should give him plenty of time to get some games in before the end of the season we talked about Lewis and how naturally disappointed and frustrated he is how's Anthony have you managed to speak to him much this week different situation naturally but I imagine the level of frustration is the same yeah I think for Anthony he's of course he was hugely disappointed on Sunday and I think there's that realization once cuz your emotions in the game that you're playing it can't be for the future but then when the game ends you sort of realize what's happened and the repercussions of that incident so I'm sure Sunday night at home and and Monday he would have been feeling all the potential negative emotions of that but I think he's very quickly come back to us trained really well you wouldn't know there's a a disappointment there huge respect to him for that and he's trying to help his teammates because now he knows his job is to train really well um be there as a support for his teammates and try and push us on to achieve something great in his absence I suppose lost amongst all the chaos of the week Bruno put out a tweet saying you know if anyone needs anyone to blame put it on me but this is a club that needs to be United going forward how important is it for you to kind of hear that from one of your leaders from the captain moving into such a crucial period Well you need leaders uh who are willing to share the responsibility of everything so for Bruno to do that I thought was was really good we got some really strong characters in the group you know people like Dan Bur Kieran trippier Callen Wilson um who will I'm sure Inspire the group even when I'm not there you know drip feed really good powerful messages into the squad we've still got everything to play for nothing's lost we've lost some important players but that was what the squad's for and all those players coming into the team will feel that they can add something different and that's really powerful to and just finally I'll end on on a positive note great news Sig Jo Linton being called back up to the Brazilian national Squad after what's been a pretty frustrating season for him how pleased were you to see that news huge news for him I'm delighted for Joe he's such a a passionate guy I mean he's had his own injury troubles and I thought one of the highs of Sunday was to see him return not just return but return in his um best way running chasing winning balls um being a real enforcer for us in that position so delighted for him and I think it's just Testament really to his character that he's back in the Brazilian squad that is an inedible feat and we're delighted for thank you Andy Nisha morning Eddie as you said a difficult week you you've got lots of problems to solve with your selection and you said you you do have this very small Squad so I guess of those players that haven't been starting have they always been ready to come on when needed and your other players are they ready to potentially play out of position if needed as well or their usual position yeah I think there the players have to be ready that's their job um and we saw on Sunday that you can be perceived to be sort of on the sidelines one minute and then you you you're thrust into action and you got to be ready to perform and you got to be ready to play this is a club with big pressures um big expectations so all that that's when all that training time all the dedication professionalism that all these players show on a daily basis really comes to the four so any player in the squad with a squad of 18 senior professionals at the moment um 17 if you exclude Anthony everyone's got to be ready to play and they got to be ready to play 90 minutes and they their Fitness levels have got to be um to that level so yeah we've been working hard with the the players behind the scenes we always do so that everyone can play their part and hopefully what will be a successful period for us Harvey bares is a player that for the most part has been a very very effective substitute for you and it must have been difficult for him when you've got Anthony Gordon who's been in great form H how has he been kind of behind the scenes over these last few months with potentially an opportunity coming up yeah well another player that's just returned from injury and great to see him back because we've really suffered with a lack of options in the wide areas and I think Harvey's return's been um a massive lift for for everybody I think you could see on Sunday that he's still working his way back to his very best sharpness levels I think he's very fit but it's just that lack of game time maybe um showed against his best performances this season but he's a huge player he's a player that's always got goals very creative um we really like Harvey he's been unfortunate that Anthony's been in such great form um but we certainly back him and I know he can make the difference and just finally for me you know you've said it all along you always think about the next game you don't want to get ahead of yourself with the Cup Final in at the training ground do the players talk about it do do you let them talk about it do they keep quiet about it do you say no talk at all of that please no I I'd never say that I don't think that's the right way to approach it um I haven't really heard those conversations between the players themselves I'm sure they do they I would almost encourage them to but I think as long as we're not distracted on what the immediate focus is we have a Premier League game on Monday and a big Premier League game we need to perform well in that game so I'm looking at the training levels I'm looking at the the focus in those training uh sessions to make sure that we don't take our eye off what's right in front of us thank you thanks Nisha to Rebecca and then Lee hi already hi um with it being a Monday game do you kind of feel like you and the squad have benefited from maybe having a couple of extra days in the wake of what's happened this week and obviously with the FA Cup to kind of prepare um going into a Premier League fixture and obviously the final next week yes so I suppose in that sense it hasn't been that bad a week after all cuz I think that was perfect for us we we had the 8 day Gap I think we needed a couple of days where we just refreshed regrouped and then came back together and sort of got everything out of our system the Brighton results the injuries that we've suffered um and I said I think I've been pleased with a response this week and it's going to be a long wait for the West Ham game this period over the weekend is always quite long when you're playing on a Monday but in some senses it increases our preparation time and just on West Ham as well is it kind of a bit of a difficult time to face them because obviously they're coming in with wins over Arsenal and Leicester you know they seem to have really kind of taken off in the last couple of games and put in some really good performances yeah I think Graham's work is is there you can see it in his perform sorry in their performances um really good result against Arsenal excellent performance that wasn't by luck I thought they um played very well and against Leicester they they did the job they needed to do um from their perspective so we know going to play any team that Gran manages they'll be flexible they'll be um very strong in the middle of the pitch and we need to uh be ready for a difficult game thanks Rebecca Lee Ian and then Chris Eddie just on the the back of the sort of last three transfer Windows has it been an extra challenge for you to keep people on the tours a little bit given you haven't been able to bring sort of fresh fresh players into the club yeah I mean uh tried to answer this question diplomatically before I think yes that that is a challenge I think I always like a fresh face coming through the door ideally every window because I think it adds a different um stimulus to the squad there's two things there's you want to impress the player that's coming in all the players um want to show their good players and also the new player coming in wants to impress everybody say that I can add value to this squad that's a really healthy thing to have um and the benefits of that are huge just on Matt Target a player who hasn't had too many headlines recently because of injuries but can you just give us an Insight on what a you know willing lad he is behind the scenes uh doesn't seem to complain now he might get some opportunities because of what's happened yeah he's exactly that he's a great professional a really really good teammate very popular in the dressing room very popular on the training ground does his job um diligently he's really looked after himself I mean he's had various injury problems the last three years that that would probably be the biggest reason why he hasn't played and of course then he's come back to of Fitness in the team invariably when he's come back has done well and has been settled and of course Lewis Hall's form this year has been really strong so um but this does present a potential opportunity for Matt and he's a player that will in my opinion never let us down he's um got a lovely left foot really really good um technical player so potentially opportunities for him on the horizon thanks Le Ian good morning Eddie morning uh Callum Wilson's got quite a phenomenal goal scoring record against West Ham I think it's said 12 in 15 games to to record to specific records of individuals against clubs does that have a bearing on your selection ever I don't know if I would pick a team based purely on on that but yes I have been aware previously when I I know when I've been picking teams and you sort of get a a gut feel that this if it's a close call between two players you might look at something like that and go well I'm going to go that that just tips it his way for this game but really you've got to look more importantly for me that how the current player is in what form he's in what condition he's in rather than the historical data it will be really that will be the the swaying factor for me and another play Dan burn has played a lot of games at left back now you haven't got a lot of options in the center defense do you consider him now A Center half and he's isn't an option anymore for the left back Bo I I wouldn't rule anything out I think that would be for foolish of me to do so especially with such a small Squad that versatility um that we have in the squad players that can play dual roles is hugely important and we do have a few players that can we we can Shuffle around but we're going to need to do that with with limited options our backline looks with these two two injuries you've had I think we've got six fit senior Defenders that's very light um so we might need all of those to play different positions thanks Chris M Edie in terms of losing Anthony and Lewis they're both obviously Left sided players so it's not just that you're losing two players you're losing the entire left hand side which is which has performed extremely well how can you quickly build relationships there with players who obviously haven't necessarily played in those roles this season in in time for a Monday but then be the final yeah that's a challenge um and that's a challenge we've been trying to work towards this week finding Solutions I think Lewis and Anthony had a very good relationship you could see that when they played I think they as the game started to um as they started to play games together and and obviously train together and the number of times that they did I think naturally you begin to understand each other's movements and preferences so yeah and potentially new look left side for us but that doesn't mean it can't be really effective especially with the players that we still have left available to play and we do have the fortunate thing is on that side of the pitch lots of players that want or have enjoyed playing Left Midfield um previously so the other side of the pitch has been a little bit more Troublesome for us so fingers crossed uh we find the right solution and just on that how important is having Joe Linton back a how close to full fitness is he and B it always feels like when he's at his full athletic and physical best and the team performs at the best and it gives you something a bit different yeah um Joe's another one of those players that can play on the left and has done done that really well for us historically I think the most pleasing thing from Sunday if I was to look for a positive would be his performance um because I thought he looked energetic he looked his normal self there they looked like there was no hangover from injury and I'm I'm not necessarily surprised by that because I'd seen the work he'd put in he trained like a an absolute Beast because he knows what's on the horizon he's of course he's got cut final aspirations Brazilian International experience motivation so he worked really really hard um but I thought he looked really good thanks Chris I got at Craig Charlie and then Dominic Eddie just on Alex can you give us a detailed sort of assessment update of where he's at Fitness wise obviously came off late in the game how is he and how will he be for Monday and then by extension the final yeah he's fine um Sunday he came off he was just feeling a bit fatigued I think towards the end of the game a bit tight and in his body so we withdrew him uh just trying to think back to this week but I he's trained every every day he's um yeah he's good and on the injuries and the adversity if you like with the suspension from that can a Siege mentality emerge can there be positives from it whereby you engender the feeling of we've had this bad Ru everything's against us can a positive potentially come from that I think a positive has to come from that for us to have any chance of being successful in the next few weeks um going to a question earlier there's no question of us feeling sorry for ourselves we believe in ourselves we believe in the group we believe how we play how we work I believe in the characters of The Players believe we got really special special team special group of people but we need to come together and we the after the Brighton game that was a difficult feeling for 48 hours but there's always a new day and there's always a new way of looking at the same situation for me I look at it as as purely from my side can I find answers to some problems um and then can we fight back even stronger thanks Greg Charlie morning Eddie just on the injury front um I'm just curious what has James buns as well be and all of this is he the one sort of leading the conversations when it comes to injuries yeah James has taken that on this season where he will I'd say his role is to coordinate everything regarding a player's injury with of course the medical team in terms of assessing the injuries getting the correct diagnosis the right treatment times and then beginning that process for the player to come back to full fitness I have to say I think he's been excellent in every respect I think he's made a really positive difference for us I think our injury record over the season has been very strong uh and in part that's down to James and the medical team and then you could probably doal with some defensive reinforcements right now is update on Jamal LEL at all making good progress um back out on the grass not training with the team yet but I'd say he'd be really happy currently with where he's at Super lean super fit um he's now in entering the last phase of his um recovery from injury and hopefully we'll see him soon thank you Dominic morning Eddie just uh reading Lewis Hall's quote yesterday on his injury it sounded like he really wanted to almost keep playing through the pain barer from your perspective was that ever an option at all well fortunately these things aren't my decision um because obviously I'm I'm weighted one way on what I want the players to do um and that's why we have experts and Specialists and I think the specialist opinion for Lewis was the big was the big game changer I think it was clear that he couldn't carry on playing and the right decision has been made we have to think of his long-term future um he's got a long career ahead of him we don't want this injury to uh to stop that progress and just on Joel lint you've touched on him just before but you just got him back and in terms of the Premier League one booking away from suspension that must be obviously more potential bad news and frustrating for you yeah unfortunately for Joey he's a very competitive player he's always on the line I'd say in terms of that side but you need players like that in your squad um yeah we we'd be desperately disappointed after losing him to injury to lose him for two two games but um hopefully he can control himself like he did the last time he was on the precipice of a of a ban I think he went a number of games without getting booked so fingers crossed he can do the same thanks Dominic we got to Kieran and then Martin to finish morning did um Anthony field the to dress the group after what happened yeah he said a couple of a couple of words to the players in the dressing room but I think at that stage everyone's highly emotional anyway but he did the right thing he stood up and took accountability and we've seen the the club's accounts released this week I'd imagine you don't have time to go through them but have you taken encouragement um AR riseing revenue and Darren has spoken about you know spending to the max within the rules this summer and that he was excited about the summer um does that give you encouragement maybe yeah you miss misread me there I was powering through the uh the numbers uh no absolutely not you're right I I wasn't um but it's good to see that the revenues are going the right way um we're doing what we can in terms of trying to expand all our income growth um and yes the club have said many times that we'll all they'll always try to maximize the spending allowed under the the current rules which is great to hear so a lot of progress made still more progress to to go thank you Martin morning Eddie morning obviously there's a huge interest in Alex and his physicality is he good to lead the line against West Ham and then obviously hopefully against Liverpool as well well fingers crossed yeah I mean as I said if he's fit to play because that's the best way to get him in the best physical condition um for future games footballers are finally tuned athletes and when they're ready to play they have to play and we have to give them that opportunity so fingers crossed Alex will be fine I understand the intense sort of speculation and Spotlight on him but the best thing we can do is just relax and let him players football is there a hunger from him to continue his Premier League goals and also there's a little bit of unfinished business with the the Cup Final because he didn't start two years ago yeah I think he's very very motivated to to score I think that's one of the things that's so good about him same with Callum they've got that desire to score in every moment every training session um yeah goal scorers have that mentality he's got it um so yeah hopefully he's able to take his place on the pitch and do that and last one with 17 players how nervous are you now in training and are people allowed to tackle each other you have to you have to be relaxed on it because I'm a firm believer that what will be will be you you you can't change fate in some respects we train smart we haven't we're not training too long um our training has been controlled as it has been all season but you can't wrap people up in Cotton wall and if you want the team to be competitive you have to train competitively so it's a it's a really um delicate thing you can't change the psyche too much we can't change what we've always done training is competitive but that's to the benefit of the team's performance
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,5hDB4FtduGg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hDB4FtduGg,hi Eddie um can we just check on Alexander isach firstly how is he doing um yeah we see today I haven't seen him since the the game so we'll um see how he is today have a long discussion with him I'm sure we don't think it's a long-term problem um in part obviously there was no risk taken on Wednesday um and they can't be with the stage of the Season that we're at so there is still potentially an element of risk and you have to get the timing of his return right whether it's Sunday or West Ham or even Wembley well there's always a risk with any player um even if they're 100% fit that's the the world that we're in but we wouldn't take any risks on his long-term Fitness um but we see how he is today and we want to um if he's Fit U you know he'll play and what about Callum Wilson who sustained a facial injury came back on but then was substituted with 20 minutes to go is he all right and is he available I believe callum's okay yeah I think he took a cut to his eye but nothing more than that I thought Callum did well in the game um yeah so fingers crossed he's fine today as well and what are the chances of both Sven botman and Joe Linton being in the squad on Sunday they they have a a chance I'd say again today's a big day for them really because I think we'll see how close they are whether they train with the team for the first time or not um but knowing both players they'll be very keen to be involved as long as they the respective injuries feel good the Cups have been really important for you um you've gone far in both Cup competitions um and with Wembley on the horizon how much are you looking forward to this FA Cup tie and the chance to to go even further in this one yeah just looking solely at the FA Cup but it's uh it's obviously a huge competition it's one that we have tried to focus on again like the the carabel cup we um we know the importance of every game we don't take it lightly we know the responsibility that we have we want to try and get back to Wembley if we can um this will be a tough game Brighton are in great form dangerous team they got a lot of good attacking players so um I think it should be a really great Cup tie the result in the home match in the league against them would have been a big disappointment for you but you played quite well didn't you that day what do you remember about the match and and what they brought to that game and and how you went up against them yeah I thought he was really good game actually I think they played well they defended really well on the day I thought we we played really well too we disappointed with the goal we conceded I think it was one of their first attacks in the game thought we were dominant but without really breaking them down efficiently I thought a lot of our play in the first two thirds was very strong that day so that that's my overall memory um but their away for has been very strong this season I think they've they found a good way of playing it's certainly going to be a test for us but I'm sure one that we can we can rise last thing from me V comes in at this stage of the FA Cup and for the first time in English football there'll be the use of the semi-automated offside technology um with that technology for offsides are you familiar with it how much do you understand it and and welcome it if it can help get faster and accurate decisions well I've just seen it like everybody else has um on various stages um and I quite liked it the visuals look like clear and simple and if it does as you say if it speeds up the game and makes those decisions quicker then I'm all for it as long as it's accurate thanks R Keith Eddie how how delicate is the the situation at the moment with with Alex because obviously you'll you won't want to aggravate the problem but you'll also want to try and get him into the team and make sure he's up to speed a ahead of the the Cup Final I'm guessing you would want him in your starting lineup on the day in the in the cup in the cup FAL sorry yeah of course I mean think we we well for provided we want to try and play our best team and strongest team I think with Alex I think it's pretty clear for me if he's fit in any game leading up to the the cut final he will play um and I think we have to have that mindset with all our players um as long as you can't save any player that they lose Rhythm so the best thing for a player to stay in good form and stay fit is to is to play them if they can that's what we try to do with with all our players with everything that that Alex brings to the table how how different is is your team with or or without him in it I think naturally with him I think when he's not playing the team takes a totally different look it's still a team that can be successful in my opinion but we'll have to do it in a different way Alex has standout qualities his game I've said many times we've molded our game to his qualities um yeah he's he's an outstanding Talent he he possesses skills and abilities and a way of playing that that makes us better in my opinion and that's no disrespect respect to anyone else that we have um thought Callum did a great job for the team um in a change of system that we felt we had to do um so there's some really good bits the other night but um I think we missed Alex the fact that you're you're still in both Cup competitions the the only team that that are um what is that doing for for for morale to it's like extending the season and giving you guys belief that you can really achieve something this year I think it's a great great thing for us I think we want the extra games we've always said that we we love the matches that's what we're here to do and the bigger game the better so this is a huge game we're at home and that's all you can ask for in a in the draw um but Brighton will come full of Confidence from their recent run having watched them closely I think it'll be a very good game um I think they've got some really good attacking players as I said earlier so it'll be a really good test for us noticed a story this week that the Manchester City are looking at Tino lento ahead of a potential move in the summer is Tino know one of the the nucleus one of the players here that that you want to build your your team around rather than lose yeah I think it goes with that same key I think it's frustrating for us that we're consistently talking about players rumors to be leaving we we we want to go the other way we want to strengthen the group we want to make our team and Squad stronger for the future rather than lose our best players thank you thanks K Adam hi Eddie Adam from BBC look North it's ni nice to meet you um anticipation certainly building towards the League Cup Final in a couple of weeks times but besides just winning games what would would you be looking for from your team in the build up to the final yeah um I think we want to be in the best mental state physical state that we can be for that game um but that's that's in the future I think I think just finding Rhythm form momentum these are all key fundamental qualities that we need I think we're in the middle of a or have been in the middle of a difficult spell of games when you look at Liverpool Notting a forest Manchester City that's a tough run of fixtures Manchester city was disappointing Forest we had some really good bits in it and Liverpool I didn't think we were um we were good in both boxes but we were good in the middle part so it's putting that all together really and finding that consistent form um for the next couple of weeks uh you talked about your tough Runner fixtures and Sunday seemed like a continuation of that bright on a team you've not beaten in the last three games tactically why are they so hard for you to break down um yeah I think I don't necessarily think tactical play has anything to do with that I think Brighton are a good team because they've got good players as we have so I think very even game in the first game we had against them I thought they defended particularly well on the day but we back ourselves if we're at our best levels we have been in overall in the recent months I think we've been in decent form so um we've just got to try and hit our best levels uh speaking of players hitting their best levels Lewis Miley's been fairly irresistible recently has he played his way into playing contention starting contention I should say yeah he's certainly pushing in the right direction I thought he was very good when he came on against Liverpool again um played very well against Nottingham Forest so he's doing everything right at the moment and just finally for me then um the decision to bring Nick Pope in over Martin Deka has been a contentious one somewhat is that one you still stand by well I think we take it on a a game by game basis as we do with all team selections I think part of the game is players can change your mind either way so um we're always looking to try and pick our strongest team and it's up to the players to either confirm their place or not thank you Edie than Adam Damian Edie you mentioned Callum earlier through no fault of his own he's not had a lot of football in the in the last year how difficult is it in that context to be thrown straight into a starting lineup and to lead the line at somewhere like Liverpool yeah it's not easy for for any player when they've had injury problems to come into the team but I wouldn't say he's necessarily been thrown in he's been back training for a good time and then he's been training with us and doing everything that all the other players have been doing for again a good period of time so I think he was ready to start he obviously played against Birmingham in the FA Cup and did well and scored um and I think on another day Callum might have been able to um score and impact that way in the Liverpool game he obviously had a good chance but he made some really good runs he looked physically good Testament again to his hard work that he's put in in his recovery and knowing him he's mentally there he's mentally ready to play thank you we go to Lee Ian and Craig Eddie just done Lewis Hall obviously he's been in great form recently you sort of trained him to play left back last season and that's starting to to really show good signs could his future still be further up the pitch as well could is there any limits on what it could be I'd probably say Lou is for us a left back um that's not to say 100% I wouldn't use him in any other position I think he has the technical skills to play in other roles but I think that's his best position for us I think he and for any Defender I think you want continuity you want to know where you're playing to consistently work on your game that the level's so high that you can't really lose focus on the fundamentals of that position so um I think he could be very pleased with his form recently he's looked really good um played well against against Muhammad Salah on Wednesday was a really good test for him and how proud are you of we're going into March now and still got chance in every competition of getting in a Europe Cup Final FA Cup uh how proud are you the players for keeping it going to this stage with all the adversity you've had yeah we're pleased but I think we we're always pushing and we're always wanting more so I think the challenge after this weekend is to still be in those competitions and this is going to be a tough game for us um but we want to hit that aggressively and we want to attack the game and we want to give it everything to try and get through to the next round thanks Lee Ian good morning Eddie uh Bruno undoubtedly has been one of your most influential players over the last two years there's been possibly a drop off in in his performances in uh in recent games do you detect any tiredness or could it be a simple case of he's missing his his compatriot Jo Linton I think it yeah I mean tiredness is a difficult one for me to measure only Bruno can truly do that but he has had a very very busy schedule if you look for for a long long time now he's been playing regularly every every week or every two three days he's always been there for us that's the standout thing for Bruno he's never shied away wants to play in every game every minute of every game he's got a great passion for the game his International schedule is also full and a lot of traveling within that as well so I think we need to protect our players at all times he's such a a special talent um of course I think that there's an element that the team has missed jolon um with his qualities that he possesses he's unlike no one else I'm not talking about Bruno individually here I'm talking about the team so uh his return I think will be very welcome okay we'll go to Craig Luke and then Dom Shaw morning Eddie you've got too many good players to be called a oneman team but are you dependent on one man for it all ultimately work no I get your I get your question no I don't think so but of course in saying that we recognize Al Alex's strengths and his abilities um I I I don't think we're a oneman team I'd never classify Us in that bracket but Alex brings unique qualities in that Center forward role in that pivotal middle role that um that we need but we have other ways of playing we have other player skill sets to utilize I do think you have to look we we were playing Liverpool the other night and that was a tough game it's been a tough game there for everyone this season but I thought there's a lot of good in it as well I don't think it was it was all bad but we yeah we we didn't hurt them enough around their box for sure and it's a real Quirk but it seems so long now since Callum and Alex were both fit together what you would call sort of Peak Fitness I can't even remember the last time it it it happened how was big of frustration is that for you that you can't get the two of them in tandem because when it did happen you saw they actually benefited for it yeah it's been a big frustration because my mind goes back to Burnley last year I think that we played them in Tandem and I I I'm sure there was other games as well um and I thought they were outstanding together they looked a real handful they L like they enjoyed playing with each other as well it brought a different dimension to us and yeah I don't feel since since then we've really had them in the best physical condition to actually play them together and even now callum's still finding his way back to his best and of course Alex is has has got this recent problem so I'd love to get to the stage where they're both 100% fit and we can maybe look at that option thank you Luke have you been working out Eddie go on oh you just look quite chiseled this a joke well thank you no I'll take it um just on um just i' just like to make you smile um Bruno does he need a rest um after playing so much much and is the is he is he sort of struggling physically a little bit um it's difficult because if you ask Bruno I'm sure he'd say no he doesn't need a rest but I think it's up to us to look at his schedule and to try and find ways to do that and we have tried albeit he's such a an important player we've um we've turned to him probably more often than we've wanted to um because of his strengths and qualities so for example in the FA Cup we tried to give him just 45 minutes in the last the last round and share that burden with Sandro um but yeah his schedule is intent and again as soon as the carabel Cup Final will be played he'll be off with his national team and that will be where the other players are getting that rest and recuperation he won't and that's part of being a top player that's part of the life that these the benefits of really being the elite player that he is but of course it comes at a cost at times and um we need to make sure we protect him presumably remains as important as ever to when Newcastle United play well Bruno tends to be playing well H yeah without a doubt I mean he's he's in the middle of everything really I mean of course his position allows that but he is behind a lot of our good Play Still um he's an outstanding player and will continue to be an outstanding player we just have to try and help him in those moments where we can keep him freshened get him to his best levels thanks Luke Dom Shaw Jordan and domar hi Eddie if Callum does get a run in the team now is it chance for him to earn a new contract yeah I've always said never written car Callum Wilson off in my head in terms of what he can bring to the team his strengths he is a goal scorer he's Strong Quick physical yeah he understands everything tactically so he's the biggest thing is just getting some momentum in his game where he can play um minutes enough minutes to recover his rhythm I think that's the the thing that he needs which is difficult to do if Alex is fit um as I said earlier we it's difficult for us to get players fit in the team they have to get fit and then execute their their skills so it's a delicate balance but callum's got every motivation to do well and I'd back him to do so thanks Jordan just on the goalkeeping situation how do you think Nick Pope has performed in the last two games since come back into the te I think with with Nick I think there's been some good bits and there's been some bits that um probably naturally when you're coming back from injury like he has been um that have been a little bit Rusty in his game but I think that's natural for any player I think he's got still believe standout qualities he's a top goalkeeper um and yeah I think he naturally with his experience and his knowledge and understanding of his own game will know um he's got high expectation of himself as well and how has Marton reacted to to not being in the team I think naturally when ever there's a uh player coming out of any position um bit of disappointment but you'd expect that and I think that's totally natural and do you have a dilemma picking between the two this weekend or is decision very clear in your head no it's it's never totally clear because you've got to get the balance right and you've got to think of the team first and foremost and that's what I always do I don't think of individuals think of what the team needs and I'll have to think about uh what I do this weekend thanks J D morning Eddie three Premier League games without Alexander isack this season no goals no wins how do you find a way to or how do you score without him in your side this season yeah well hopefully we don't have that uh that dilemma but if we do I'm sure we have the players that are capable of fixing that problem now whether that's me looking at something tactically or however we do it we still have some very very good players within the squad and just how did his injury come about was it Fallout from The notam Forest game or was it training ground no it was uh after the game he just after the the day after the game he felt absolutely fine no problems and then it was the the second day which can sometimes happen in the players bodies um where he just felt a bit stiff so woke up and just didn't feel 100% right and from there it was pretty clear on the match day that he wouldn't play thanks to Jason Miller oh hi Eddie um a lot of bookmakers have you similar to win either the caraba cup or the FA Cup um given who you play in the final of the caraba cup um do you think the FA Cup actually gives you better chance of silver this season I don't think too much about either to be honest the bookmakers will do their stuff and I fully respect that um and we've just got to do ours so I'm you can't look at odds and chances of winning we've just got to try and beat Brighton and that will be our Focus
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,1HggRUo3-lM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HggRUo3-lM,good morning Eddie um firstly can we just have another thought on the match against Nottingham Forest obviously a brilliant result for you took you back up the table but you weren't too happy with the way the second half played out yeah second half was in total contrast to the first I think we struggled with set plays that that was a a big part of our game that didn't function well in the second half and technically we fell off for where the high levels that we were first half so um I think think on reflection I think definite positives to take from that first half that was us our attacking best and uh lessons to be learned from the second half You've Won 13 of your last 16 matches and you had that brilliant winning sequence over Christmas but consistency keeps coming up and it's a word that a lot of supporters are using as well and perhaps we saw that on Sunday the inconsistency within a game how big of an issue do you feel it it it is or is becoming it's been there all season to a degree I think there's been games where we've been frustrated with ourselves but then when you mentioned the statistic 13 wins out of 16 that that's not an inconsistent team I'd certainly take that again in the next next 16 games um but I try to be very honest and acknowledge the fact that we have been inconsistent at times and um Saturday certain Sunday certainly reflected that how well will you have to play at anfield to stand a chance of getting something well I think we're near close to a a perfect game from our perspective um certainly I think learning from the recent game against Manchester City would be a useful starting point for us where we didn't execute the aggressive game plan that we wanted we weren't we didn't attack enough for me we didn't attack the game well enough um so we need to learn from that and um at anfield which is uh a really great environment to play football but not not a great environment if you're not totally there so we have to acknowledge that and make sure that we turn up and what about the emotional side of it because I think the last couple of games you've had there there's been a lot of emotion a lot of feeling in them there's been perhaps some controversial decisions as well the atmosphere is always noisy how important is it for the players to get that side of it right yeah psychologically huge I think I'd love to think we can go there and grow from that um environment that you talk about it is it's an emotional Stadium I think highlighted by before the game and and everything that goes into it certainly we're going to need to start the game well we're going to need to um put our foot forward in the game and be aggressive as I said earlier and we have to have a threat in the game we have to attack so that's what we try to do and last question Sandro tanali mentioned on Sunday that he'd had a slight injury which is why he was left out of the starting 11 and did he come through the time he had on the pitch okay and and are you satisfied that there's no longer term problem yeah he came through fine I'm anticipate now will be fully fit thanks R Keith Eddie you said there you need um as close to a perfect game as possible what is a a perfect game look like how long you got keth well we need yeah every aspect of our game to be functioning as it as it was in the first half really against not and Forest albeit we conceded the first goal um that apart I thought we responded really really well we were free flowing we were Dynamic flexible in terms of our tactical play we showed no fear when we attacked the game and scored four great goals and in a period of time where we were um in in a great moment we had a great flow about us and we lost that in the second half and we're going to need that attacking Verve that we had in that first period and how do you start mosala the the best attacking player you would suggest in the in the Premier League at the moment yeah that's going to be a challenge for us I think it's always not down to any one individual within the team although he will naturally come up against a direct opponent it will be about the team supporting that area of the pitch um I think against Arsenal was a great game to reflect on the recent home game in the carabel cup where we be defended in twos threes fours we had a mentality that we wanted to defend our goal to the to the highest level I don't think we've consistently had that in recent weeks um but we're going to need that in this game is there a chance of of Sven being being involved this week fen's improving and he's improving quickly so um we'll see whether he makes the game or not he'd be close and how How is how's Martin being after the the weekend obviously dropping out in in place of of Nick Pope have you had to have a a conversation with him yeah of course I had a conversation with Martin um it's always difficult because every player wants to to play and I have many difficult conversations with many players on a regular basis and that's part of my job U but Martin's a top professional and he responded the right way just finally from me um the the club chairman was there on on Sunday to took the match and um it appears there's been a couple of board meetings over the last couple of days what is your understanding of of of what went on and have you managed to speak to the the chairman during his time here yes I've had various conversations with with him um I think A lot's been discussed at the uh the various board meetings that you you mention probably not for public consumption I'll leave that I wasn't in all of those meetings I was in some of them um but I'm sure some positive outcomes and the club will be moving forward thanks Keith Andy on D you said you need to go away after Sunday and kind of try and find a a solution to these inconsistencies both in game and from game to game so I guess it told me a day later but have you found any solutions or not well I think Solutions I think the the big thing for me was to tr just try try and find out what happened in that game from a mental perspective because for me it was a mental falloff rather than a technical or tactical issue um and I don't know whether we had half an eye on Wednesday and thinking the game was at 41 over I don't I don't know um I always say in these things it's never it's never one thing there's never you can click your fingers and everything's reversed um it's a case of identifying things and then working on things and which will will do today and training um we will review in depth as we always do with the players and then we move forward together I think overriding that the most positive thing is what a response from the Manchester City game where we go one nil down uh after the Manchester City game that could have been a difficult moment but the players gave more gave extra and played really well in that first half so I think that's what I would like to focus on mainly if that's possible definitely possible uh I've wrapped my brains to try and think of a question that you haven't already been asked about Alexander isach so I'll give it me Best Shot faster than the likes of Kane Aguero on re to reach 50 Premier League goals does that kind of group that caliber of players just sum up how good Alex has been in this time frame yeah I think that's a good question because um I haven't been asked that before so well done um I I do think it highlights how well he's done done when you look at the the names that you mentioned there and also you put that together when he first came to the club here with um if my memory is right just survived relegation so it wasn't as if he was joining a team that was right at the top of the league and and free scoring in that moment so we've had to try and become that team but I just think he's come in with a great attitude to the club he's come in hungry to succeed eager to help the team he's not been selfish in that period he's not thought of himself he's always played for the team and I'm delighted for it you said something to me I think it was around about this time last year uh that patience is really important when it comes down developing younger players are we seeing the rewards of that patience I know we talk about Lis Marley but with Lewis hall because he was almost back to his best at the weekend I think there's patience needed in in certain cases I think every player's different every player's development from their teens to their early 20s it's a it's a crucial stage if you're going to become a regular Premier League player for a club like Newcastle there's a lot that goes into it so I think all players will have Peaks and troughs there'll be good bits and bad bits but I think as long as you're consistent and with your feedback and we try and develop and help the players if there's areas of their game that need help that's all we can do while giving them an environment that they can enjoy and feel comfortable in um these things matter so with players like Lewis Hall who has done incredibly well overall if you take a bird's eye view of his career at Newcastle I think he's been excellent um and again on Saturday I thought he attacked brilliantly in that first half with Anthony and um with Joe willick on that left down side he played a key role in us um dominating that first period just finally uh Five Points now separating third and eight for a competitive block like yourself how much are you relishing this level of competition this challenge with so many teams packed into that European risk it's very interesting isn't it cuz if you look at the top Liverpool quite a long way clear um this is an interesting mix of of teams um some maybe expected to be there some have had outstanding Seasons I think just from our Viewpoint we're we're in there fighting and scrapping for those places and that's what we're continue to do thanks Andy we've got to Damian Lee and then Ian Ed just ask about leis Miley watching him on on Sunday it looked like he's he's physically bulked out since last season at one point there was a burst of pace of not particularly Nots before is it easy because he's so young to forget that he's actually still growing into his body in a in a sense yeah very much so and I think for us we have to remember that a lot I think when he played the number of games that he did last year he looked like he was coping with the load with ease there looked to be no strain on his body now 17 years old then he developed a bat problem which uh was a a big blow for him at that stage uh so we need to recognize that fact look after him um with the utmost care at this moment in time in his career because he he has the look of a guy in his early 20s as you say he's he's filled out he looks stronger quicker um but he's still going through growth spurts and his body will still be changing on a on a daily basis so we need to have that in mind all the time and and he has the physical stature of a of a St Gerard perhaps what is there a player you would want him to study as he looks to develop his his career I think It ultimately depends up what position he ends up playing so for us on Sunday he played as a a number eight box to boox we want energy sprinting we want a lot of physical um output in that position as a number six he would play with a little bit more um control on that physical side of his game so Steven gered I think is a great one to look at because I think Steven had that same same frame Louie possesses um but as you said he had that yard of pace he could go box to box and he could score goals so great to see Louie contribute goalwise that's two goals in a short period of time and um showing that he he can do that part of the game which he's going to need to do in that position thanks Damen late Eddie you obviously left de braa on Sunday and a couple of other players have have been told on the bench do you have to have that level of sort of iciness in you now at this stage of the Season where you are going to be upset and people and maybe you're not going to be you're not going to be popular around around the place oh really I've got used to that a long time ago Lee um if you're after popularity don't become a football manager um because you have to make tough decisions and you have to upset people and it's the last thing that I want to do on a personal level with any of my players is disappoint them upset them but I'm in the position where I have to do that on a on a daily basis weekly basis I can only pick 11 I have a squad of uh 20 at the moment that's that's training regularly and some really tough calls on players that I really admire and really like that aren't playing so that that's the level of squad we have um all I ask is the Players accept the decision and then try to force their way back in if Sven does come back in for this game I guess it gives you another dilemma of maybe you have to change system or again go back to making an unpopular call for somebody else yeah but I think that's what you want I think you need the competition you need people performing well um to drive standards and to drive the quality of our training uh and ultimately improve the team so I think the players know that they have to be on their toes with the standard of the squad now but also we have a lot of games um everyone will get their opportunity and continue to get their opportunities to Showcase that they should start whether that's starting the game or from from the bench and that is their moment and of course there's training every day so I see everything so there's there's there's really no excuses ultimately when I pick the team it will usually be based on what I've seen one on Liverpool the changed formation to I don't think they used formation whatever it was it was a strange one at man city um does that change your preparation now because I think in 25 games that they had a consistent system yeah you say that I think every team has things that they they tweet game to game depending on their opponent there's very few teams in the Premier League now that play the same way week in week out it can appear that visually from in terms of starting systems but there's always there's tweaks and I think Liverpool are one of those teams that do change quite quite a bit um but it's subtle things it's not necessarily big shifts in system I think they've been very consistent with that in that respect um and naturally when they've been as successful as they are they haven't had to change too much they've been in a good moment the players have performed very well um AR's done an incredible job with the squad so it doesn't change too much from our perspective because we're always looking at these things and seeing what we need to do to try and win the game thanks Lee I've got to Ian George and then Luke morning Eddie morning uh Virgil Van djk in the last couple of days has come out and said uh Liverpool need to make an the horrible place for for visitors how do you react to that and do you think you've got a squad group of players who thrive in a hostile environment yeah well I think their record at anfield this year has been this season's been very strong wrong so I think whatever they're trying to do they they've been doing it well from their Viewpoint I think we can only look from ours and from our Viewpoint we have to be um mentally very strong in this game we have to be very clear on what we're trying to do tactically um and we have to have the strength to try and impact our game plan on them you mentioned tactics and you mentioned Sven botman could be available again would you consider playing all three center backs like you did in the I consider everything whether I actually do it or not I don't know um but naturally I think when you've got good players you're always thinking of ways to get your your best players consistently into the team but not to the detriment of the team I think that's the key Point um it has to work we felt it would work against Arsenal um I'm sure there'll be other games that will utilize that system thanks George morning Eddie with the other game on the horizon which I won't name does any part of you have to be a poker player tomorrow night um well I've never was never any good at poker um so there's a bit of breaking news for you uh no I don't think so I think this game in isolation takes takes preference over any future game that we have so we'll look at this game in total isolation and just try and deliver something that we think can give us the best conditions to try and win and that will be the same for any future games we have so we um we're not trying to be clever we just want to try and win this game and then obviously not expecting um State secrets from here but in in terms of your discussions with the chairman were they supportive were they encouraging have you have you taken heart from those discussions yeah I always take heart from seeing him and talking with him because you see his passion for Newcastle and you see how much he directly cares about everything that's going on here so um no good conversations um he's was in good spirits and enjoyed seeing us win thank you Luke um leis Miley's come in for a lot of Praise I think he was highlighted on Match of the day too which I I suspect you didn't watch um but what are how good can he be and what are the pitfalls for him as as as a young player at 18 who's who's sort of breaking out into the Premier League and getting all that attention I didn't watch it cuz I was in bed asleep at that time um so I could face you guys fresh today uh was it okay apologies for that you can tell that I didn't watch it genuinely didn't watch it um uh pitfalls how good can he be and what are the what are the pitfalls for an 18y old at a club like you yeah well he he he can be I know I say this quite a bit but he can be anything in the respect that he could he could really um take his position solid solidify that position and be outstanding for us for a number of years now he's going to need a bit of luck to do that because every player needs to stay fit and injury free and that's why I say we need to look after him especially in this early moment in his career I think that's important and I take that Duty seriously um but he has all the technical capabilities and most importantly the mental capabilities and he's shown that played some huge games but played them just normally like he does in training which is a huge compliment he can do a little bit of everything Louie he's got the the running capacity the the uh the the big big lungs that and it'll enable him to physically need produce what he needs to produce in those positions um yeah he's very composed in training he's one of our best technical players so I see a bright future but he'll end have all the pitfalls that young players have he needs to stay very humble very level needs to concentrate on his training needs to try and listen to his coaches um take on a lot of information that he'll get and take it step by step um pivoting to uh the goalkeepers what what does Nick Pope give you as a goalkeeper and how good has he been for you as Newcastle manager yeah well I think you go right back to the start and again you look at it look at Journey he's had with us I think he's been outstanding he uh is a big presence Nick obviously in size but also personality um well- liked within the squad very humble person works extremely hard um very good from set plays and and his physical frame and and coming out and you know catching or or punching from from those situations for me one of the best shot Stoppers if not the best shot stopper in the uh in the Premier League he's always had the ability historically to make big saves so um I think there there is Big strengths and we're certainly going to need them in the coming weeks just finally um I don't know what you can say you've been quite heavily linked with a move for James Trafford the Burnley goalkeeper um to the extent that people were saying personal terms agreed is there anything you can say on that please I don't believe we're in that situation with any player um because um the summer Windows a long way away and we've not begun those discussions thank you thanks L I've got to Jordan Joe and then Kieran morning EDD just on Lewis Hall how how pleased you been with his attack and output this season and can he improve on it as well yeah I think we've worked worked hard with Lewis in that respect and he's worked hard on his game he's done a lot of work I can picture him now after training working on his crosses his delivery um getting into those positions as well we work a lot on relationships in the team and building those relationships especially attacking wise with the players that you're playing with so you get to know each other's game so I think Lewis has attacked really well he's got a number of assists I still feel there's room for improvement um the attacking play of our fullbacks is fundamentally so important to how we play and we want both players to attack and attack regularly um and yeah we we work a lot on the relationships between our wide men and our our fullback so um Lis can be pleased but I know he want more and defensively as well how much you feel he's came this season in terms of that aspect of his game and how much will that be challenged tomorrow night but against probably Mo Salah yeah I think he'll know tomorrow that he's going to have a real um battle on his hands if he plays and Muhammad Salah plays I think um probably the ultimate test in the Premier League really if you look positionally for a left back is to to do well against a player of his qualities and he's got standout qualities and he the way that he plays you sort of know what he's going to do but it's very difficult to stop um and Liverpool find ways to get him a lot of the ball as well so um credit to him and the team for how he's performed this year um it' be a big test for us to stop their right hand side thanks Jordan Joe hi Eddie um just wondering about an update on Joe Linton and how close he is for tomorrow or obviously Sunday's game again with Joe similar to to Sven really improving doing really well um pushing and again he's another player that will be quite close and how big will if he is able to play tomorrow will he be with that right side you know with Trent and moal his sort of defensive attribute and ball winning attributes how important would he be in that battle I think Joe's always important from a number of perspectives and certainly defensively and defending set plays are two of those key aspects that we've missed when when he's not there he brings a a physicality and a strength that when he's missing we um there an obvious presence missing in our Midfield so Joey's a a massive player for us we hope to get him fit uh very soon and final one for me just on Harvey Barnes he's obviously struggled to nail down a regular spot with injuries last year and the form of Anthony Gordon what what do you see is his role between now and sort of the end of the season well I see his his aim should be to to play regular he's an outstanding player Harvey's been missed by us with his injury he has the ability to play Both Sides we're light in terms of wide men and Harvey's absolute Premier League quality and he'll I always believe if Harvey plays he'll get goals so um massive player to introduce we delighted his fit now we need to get him back to his very best thanks John what to Kieran Craig and Martin um morning um I appreciate you can't say much about the meetings you were in but were you encouraged by what you saw what you heard about the club's Direction and strategy moving forward you're right I can't say anything um and I was yeah I was I was I was very pleased because the ambition the drive to be successful um is still very much there from everyone connected with the club and you went to anfield a couple of seasons ago and were booed off even in defeat really got under Liverpool skin is that decided the game you want to see from your team tomorrow again um yeah I think we want to be competitive and and we want to we always respect our opponents but as soon as the whistle blows we're there to win and we're there to to do everything in our powers to try and get that result so I want to see that determination from the team I don't think we saw it against Manchester City there was a sort of an inevitability with our performance of what was going to happen and that can't happen in any away game thank you Craig morning Eddie the first half on Sunday showed exactly what your team is capable of at its best did the second half Focus Minds with regards some of those in attendance as to the need for more the need for reinforcement after two years without um I I I don't know I think I can only look at it from my perspective which I try to do and I always try trying to control what I can control so I was disappointed personally in myself in the second half um I felt I I needed to do more to try and help the team and I always try and take that responsibility internally because if I'm looking external all the time and we need this and we need that um if I don't get it then I'm not directly helping the players and that's what I always try to do in every moment so I I'll take that on myself um but of course I think it goes without saying we we haven't had investment in the team due to PSR for a number of Windows and that of course directly has a knock on effect I'm not blind to that that fact and I've commented on it many times but in the meantime I need to try and do better okay Mar um how important are these meetings taking place at the minute Eddie and does there need to be ma to change to compete with the likes of Liverpool um yeah we we we certainly go to the second part of Craig's question really we certainly need if we're going to catch the teams above us um we're going to need to drastically improve everything that we're delivering still and that goes right across the board in every Department of the football club because we have so much to do to get to the top it's not going to happen just by thinking it it's not going to happen by willing it we we have to actually deliver it and that takes money that takes investment that takes smart thinking strategic thinking which I know is going on at the club um but then we need to implement it all and along them lines how frustrating has it been to kind of put the breaks on the club for the last 18 months yeah well I think the just in purely in terms of investment and taking the team forward of course we've taken a bit of a hit and we understand that and I acknowledge that um but it's through no one's fault and we have to live in the world of the reality um we know that we want to take the team forward again we're desperate to do that we have ideas to do it and hopefully we can make that happen in the future and last one you've proven the team can compete with the top clubs um Can it compete financially with those clubs at some point in the future and has that message been reiterated the last few days I think it can in the future in terms of an actual date for that I think that's very difficult to predict from my perspective but definitely there's I think if there's a willingness and there's ideas and and bright thinking we can get there may take a bit of time cuz these clubs that we're talking about are way ahead of Us in terms of their income um but that's all part of the club's growth and that will take time I think everyone would acknowledge that
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,JWoNHhGv8e8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWoNHhGv8e8,good morning Eddie um yesterday news uh from the club that Martin Deka had signed a new contract uh at one stage in January it looked as though he could be on his way but now he's going to be with you beyond this season how pleased are you to get it sorted yeah pleased to sign Martin um to a new contract thought it was important in January we definitely didn't want to destabilize the the team or the group with a a departure in a position that we couldn't afford that to happen so um yeah delighted to he stay and now that all this is sorted the certainty about his future how much do you think that will help him not that you would necessarily have known um about the the stuff going on behind the scenes given the way that he's played since coming back into the team yeah I I don't see a change in Martin he's very experienced um especially during that month of January which was probably the most challenging time for him because there was as you say a bit of uncertainty over his future he responded really well to that um partly down to his experience and he's probably seen all of these situations before in his career so uh yeah it's over now and he can just focus on his football and there's also been a contract extension for Emil craft why was it important for you as a club to keep him here for another season well I think with Amil his firstly his character and his attitude um stands out very reliable consistent performer but his versatility his ability to play different roles is so important for a small Squad to have players that can cover in various positions and I think whenever he's played this year Emil's been very very good so I think he fully deserves his contract extension you haven't had Sven botman for the last couple of matches is he fit and available for this weekend don't think he'd be a fit and available for this weekend we're going to have to see how things stand um over the weekend for next week that's bar a remarkable recovery for this weekend um he's making progress he's making good progress um but just not as quickly as we wanted it to so he's on track there's been no setback or anything yeah no he's very much on track just yeah not not quite ready and how's Joe Linton getting on in his recovery from injury doing really well pushing as Joe always does um we just need to make sure we introduce him at the right time last weekend was obviously such a disappointment you weren't like yourselves um how certain are you that there won't be a repeat of that in the weeks ahead with all the big games coming up taking into account the quality of your opposition last Saturday well there's there's no certainties in football um that that I can say with no doubt um but I think there's an understanding that we didn't perform I think there's an understanding of what we didn't do well enough we've certainly covered that with the players this week and we expect a big response and notingham Forest finally um they've continued their incredible run into this part of the season um there's obviously lots of reasons why but among them is Chris Wood 18 Premier League goals now um I'm sure you're not surprised to see him do well pleased for him I imagine he had an incredible season hasn't he he has he's I think he's been outstanding I mean Chris when he came to us helped us in a a really difficult situation fighting relegation we felt we needed a a focal point in that position someone who could take a lot of pressure off us as a team give us a physical presence thought he did all those things I thought he was outstanding for the team probably often underestimated how much he affected our our style and our play that enabled us to stay in the league and he was an everpresent and did really well um and then of course with um callum's return to Fitness and Alex's arrival um he ended up moving on and just delighted for him on a personal level because he's a great character gave everything for us regularly I can remember him doing so much for the team filling in positions um sprinting back doing things that Center forwards don't normally do he's still doing that for nothing for us but he's he's scoring a lot of goals as well and a different variety of goals I think that's the big plus for him headers goals with his feet goals on counterattacks um so yeah really pleased for him Ed on Sven um do do you need to take extra K given previous with with his knee I don't think particularly k I think it's a totally different injury to the knee um that he had previously um we'll just judge the injury in isolation as soon as he's ready and and fit then of course we'll look to get him back involved as quickly as possible um if anything it helps his knee to again to strengthen and he'd be spending a lot of time in the gym to make sure he's fully fit when he returns how's Dan bar now Dan's good yeah Dan's trained this week no problems okay uh and any other injury issues on top of the ones you've already mentioned ahead not can think of um when you look at the when you look at the the last two League results performances um at home and you compare compare that to the the home performance uh against Arsenal in the cup how important is it that this Sunday you get an Arsenal performance and and not a Bournemouth or fulam yeah um I think it's vitally important that we perform um it's vitally important that we show the energy and desire need needed to to win this game this will be a very difficult match for us not Forest have been excellent on the road this year they've been consistent they've have a way of playing regardless of what system they play they have a style and a way of playing that is very difficult to play against um so we don't underestimate the The Challenge and the the the strengths they have in their game but for us I want to see a much more vibrant performance than our the home games that you mentioned there um I want to see us attack I want to see us be very much ourselves um and be a real goal threat in the game and I think want to see our attacking players Express themselves in in a in a really good way and of course learning from Manchester City I want to see us really aggressive off the ball and returning to our R best and obviously a season is full of sort of mixed performances there are ups and downs but can you put your finger on why perhaps it hasn't been that vibrancy in in certain games and we have seen it in in other big games if you like yeah I always say with these things Keith that that there's never one sole reason it's always a combination of factors and those combination of factors are varied and too long to talk about here but I think we we've shown that we can turn it on we've shown that we can be a very difficult team to play against and certainly not so long ago we were very consistent with that we went through a long winning run where we look very stable we look very um certain of ourselves we looked um clear in what we were trying to do and it's amazing how football can work and then in a couple of games later we don't look that cohesive team that we had been for so long so of course that's the challenges we Face the opposition will always plan for us as we plan for them so um we might have to find another way um but as long as the players are expressing themselves in the best way and I see the performance levels of the players close to their best I think we'll be fine Andy moned we we heard some kind of emotional words after Manchester City not least from Bruno in an impassioned interview what sort of emotions have you seen from a players in training this week have you seen that kind of anger and frustration about the city performance this week and Tren um I'm trying to give you an honest answer here um no I don't think we've seen anger I I think there's definitely been a sense of disappointment um definitely that's come through but I think we've trained I the attitude to training is very good the quality sometimes you can question you we got a much smaller group at the moment um and a weaker group with a few injuries as well so I think that's had a slight KnockOn effect but the attitude's there and I think the hunger is there to then put that performance to bed and put it right and I think that's the main thing the intention then has to be very strong to come back and show our true selves we we've seen this squad you know in difficult positions before this season not least after brenford for instance what makes this squad so good at bouncing back from setbacks and What Makes You confident that they can do so again well I think fundamentally it's always about attitude I think behind the team is a very strong character group of characters very strong will to do well very strong will to represent the club in the right way I think that that its heart is one of our biggest strengths and the good strong leadership within the player group I think they know the expectations that they need to reach we know we didn't do that as a group and I think then there's a really strong will to come back and and fight back but nothing's ever easy and nothing's given to us so um and then there's no guarantee so we have to create that guarantee with how we approach this game Lewis males has had to be pretty patient this season given the form of a Midfield it looked really really good when he came on against Manchester City again how much of an opportunity do you think this is to kind of solidify and really really make a run for a starting birth consistently for him yeah I think he's very much in around that position at the moment I think his performance against Manchester City as you say was probably the the one big positive to take from the game there wasn't many but he approached the game in the way that really we should have done from the start he was Brave in both phases aggressive off the ball Brave on the ball Fearless in his approach and played his normal game and I thought he played very strongly just finally You' spoken about Chris woods and being personally delighted for him Elliot Anderson how delighted are you for the fact that he's now making him up we all knew the talent that he'd seen we'd seen here at Newcastle he's demonstrating that on a weekly basis now for Forest isn't he yeah he is whenever I see not Forest play he's a player that catches my of course because I know him and know his game inside and out and I think he's been a real creative Force for them sometimes from a deeper area um but very uh very passionate very very gifted player and Bittersweet for me to watch him play for n Forest because pleased for him on a personal level but obviously disappointed for us that we lost such a great player thanks Andy Nisha morning um can we have an update on Jamal lal's recovery please yeah Jamal's continuing to work I think he he was the last player to leave yesterday um with some of the staff he he works extraordinary long hours to try and get himself fit I think it was here till 5:00 again yesterday dedicated as you've you've seen a player try to return from injury he's had various problems and little setbacks nothing during his recovery but just little moments that have ended up knocking his recovery back so he's been on the grass he's been um training with individually with physios hasn't got beyond that stage yet but I think he's in a pretty good place we're probably looking towards the end of the season um as a return date for him you've spoken already about the positive news about Martin deka's contract how has that battle for the number one spot evolved over the last few weeks between him and Nick Pope um yeah it's an interesting way to describe it I think for me Nick's come back from a an injury now Nick was pushing to come back early really from the assessment I think was given six weeks from his knee injury I think he ended up I think at five did very well to come back um but Nick's just been I think getting his field back I think goalkeeping is such a unique position um getting your Rhythm back as a goalkeeper um got good game minutes against Birmingham which would have been great for him and I thought he performed well so the battle you talk about really for me is just trying to see both players at their best levels and then of course it's my job to pick one okay we'll try and squeeze in as many as we can we'll start with Damen we'll go to Ian and then Craig hi Eddie just going back to Chris Wood was selling him in hindsight an indication of how you were going to have to trade throughout this period or was it just a case that you were looking to go a different way at the time um well definitely trading is something I've said many times we have to do it's not a it's not a a choice we have to trade players out uh and at that stage we had to trade players out um as a necessity obviously building the necessity was building upwards um as we approached the next window but also there was a the side for Chris because Chris was at that stage um not getting the game minutes that he he wanted and it was his big push really to to want to go rather than my wish to lose it okay morning Eddie still on the Chris Wood theme did you ever you're clearly admire of the player but did you ever envisage him being up there with with har and Isaac and Salah in the goal scoring charts I never doubted Christ's ability um hence when he was here I you know before obviously the signing of Alex and depending on callum's availability played regularly for us and he played very well now he didn't score the goal go are he scoring now but he was such a pivotal part of the team and I think I remember sitting here on a regular basis saying how good I thought he was for us and the fact we were winning games in part the number that we were was down to his his General performance was very strong um but as I said earlier I think it's the variety of goals that he scored has been so impressive um totally different array of goals which is making him a difficult player to Mark and that's someone that for for our perspective our Defenders are going to have to play very well against him this weekend and why didn't he score the goals for new which he is doing for forest and he did for some of his previous clubs well you can never I can never give an answer to that because I'm not behind the scenes in not in Forest um but for us he he played his role in helping probably other players score um more goals than he did himself he was very selfless for us he played an incredible role and I think he supported the team and his teammates un unbelievably well here okay so Craig Jason and then Louise morning Eddie we spoke you down at the edad last week about the the possibility be it subconsciously otherwise of players playing with one eye on the cup final you said you wanted time to digest that theory have you this week and what would your message be to any player who perhaps does think the place is guaranteed for Wembley the reason I laugh is I should never say that to you uh Craig should I I need time to digest because then you always want to uh an answer the other side um yeah the cut phone is irrelevant for me absolutely irrelevant um in terms of looking back at Manchester City we just have to look at Manchester City in isolation and the isolation of that game I don't think we were we were aggressive but we weren't aggressive enough we didn't follow through with our actions enough I thought we got to a certain level of our off the ball play but it it stopped at a certain point and we lack that that bravery I think to really fully Implement what we wanted to do um and that actually left us in a more vulnerable position so for whatever reason we didn't fully commit and that would be the same on the ball I don't think we fully committed on the ball I don't think we were brave enough on the ball so I think there's a lot of stuff to grow from that game both in and out of possession that we Tred to put right for the next game and that that for me the Cup Final was not part of that you say that about the Cup Final and that's understandable given where you are in the league you know a lot of what we asked and talk about is framed in the context of the cup final but you've still got the Champions League there and you said I think it was in September any player who's got Ambitions to be a Champions League player well achieve it here first does that message still stand of course it does from my perspective everything's about us and Newcastle and I can't look beyond anything other than this season and in this moment and the challenge for us and the the coaching staff the players is to finish as high as we can in the league and our Target should be what's immediately ahead of us and above us we have to try and Chase down teams like knam forest and the the various teams that we have above us in the league that's a small Target of points I don't think it's impossible for us to achieve it but certainly the game we have coming up is potentially a big moment in that because if we let our immediate opposition slip away from us as in nottingam Forest it becomes very very difficult to make that Gap up so important games for us coming up in the next few weeks Jason hi Eddie um just a bit more color on Chris Wood's time at the club really um was he a joker was he on the end of jokes I know he's a proud New Zealander did you chat Cricket with him was he trying to hijack the playlist and getting Crowded House and K Tano were on the playlist stff like that getting allow to do a hacker before a game well actually one of my Vivid memories of Chris talking about the hacker was him in his initiation moment doing the hacker hugely impressive thing he's such a big lad that he was fully engaged fully aggressive and he delivered it to a really high standard but I think Chris is a character Chris is a strong a strong person and that's why when he came into the club when we were in a desperate position in the league he immediately solidified the group you need strong characters in that moment you need players that have been in that position many times before but he rolled his sleeves up he went to work and I think he could be really proud of his time at the club I think people too often look at statistics and and sort of draw their judgment from just numbers Chris's time isn't defined by that for me he's defined by what he did to the group and how he helped to stay in the league thank you we got to Louise Lee and then Mark Louise hi Edie I'm just just wondering you've got a sort of minor gap between the the Brighton game and the West Ham game on the Monday night are you thinking about taking the team away somewhere warm to sort of decompress have a rest and maybe work on tactics in the Sun be nice wouldn't it no we're not no we're not I think you got to remember we got an international break coming up pretty soon after that and the players will be traveling all over the world for their country so I don't necessarily think traveling at that moment will benefit the players so we'll do our intense work in the sun here so so you think sometimes these things can be counterproductive yeah I'm not I'm not yeah no I'm a big believer in taking the players away and working with them with minimal distractions and staying with the players for longer which is obviously the benefit of traveling to a destination but I think you have to sort of try and read the schedule of what the players have Beyond and before that and work out whether it's the right time to do it thank you than L Eddie I know it was real Madrid who dismantled Man City the other night but did you look at that came with a bit of regret that your team wasn't able to to have that flying start uh given what was said before the game and how vulnerable manset you've looked this season yeah I never said anything about Manchester City being vulnerable for me they I think I said postgame for me they're still the best team in the buildup and I think the team that they played against us was a very strong team and we we didn't as I said in my answered earlier I don't think we were brave enough we were Brave to a point but we weren't brave enough enough and that Fearless approach has become part of our identity we have to have that in every moment against every opposition I can't talk too much about Real Madrid they're a they're a different level to us um but we have to certainly learn from that game on this game not and far as some names player five across the Midfield could patience be the key word going in this game yeah I think patience is important at home you never know how the game's going to going to go you never know what position we're going to be in you'd love to think positive and think you know we can really attack the game and express ourselves in a really good way and um be the team that we we want to be but we have to be adaptable if that's the case then we'll we'll have to do that and patience could be a key thing for us thanks L we' got Mark and Luke and Scott please he talked there about Champions League um how transformative would it be for the club to get back in there and is that a really motivating factor for you with these next few games yeah transformative yeah I I don't know if that's necessarily the right word but it would certainly help in every aspect it would help us um continue our journey really in a positive way continue to build on the experiences that we had in our previous campaign um and I think it would help the evolution of the club um for me it's a big motivation it's a big driver we want to achieve we want excitement we want the season to have a great end in in lots of different ways and we want to give ourselves the best chance to do that in various competitions so that's why it's important we get our Premier League formed back on track you you mentioned there about home form as well how important is a quick start at home because it seems like when you come out the blocks the crowd lift and and the whole sort of feeling of the game is different yeah a it's a it's an important thing and I think it's it's a two-way thing if we can get the crowd in the game if we can start the game well obviously it transforms the feeling and a lot of the time the players are playing on feelings they're playing on the feeling of the stadium they're playing on the feeling of their own emotion so um we have to try and make that as positive as we can thank you Luke when your team's good it can be brilliant but when it's off it it can be sort of an infuriating side to watch is it infuriating for you I'm just trying to think if I would describe it is infuriating I think there's a frustration there and I think there has been at time different times this season of course but I think the players share that they're they're human they share the emotions that I share when they watch a performance it's either relation or it's it's disappointment very rarely for us this season it's been in the middle there's been no very rarely Middle Ground um but you have to understand the game that we're in it is that kind of game you for most teams in the Premier League this year probably apart from apart from Liverpool and you look at a couple of other teams who had outstanding Seasons like not forest and Bournemouth and and teams like Fulham everyone else has had those those moments where we've been frustrated and then we have to come back and be strong again the league is so tough and everyone's expectations are different as well so we can only live in our world and our world is that we've had some really good games we've had some disappointing games but we're just looking to genuinely improve our performances and be more consistent and the challenge starts this weekend just Fally you got are you still confident that your players got the strength of character the focus to have a positive reaction like they have done previously to set backs this season yeah I don't doubt the players in terms of character I said that earlier I think we've got a brilliant group of people who want success um we're not perfect we've got a very small Squad we've got challenges but I've never never shied away from the fact that I really believe in the players we have got Scott Chris and then Martin hi Eddie um you spoke about Elliot a few times and how excited you were by him and obviously how hurt you were to lose him do you see the same level of potential in Lewis can he get to where Elliot is now as a as a kind of nailed on regular Premier League start and and how much of Lewis's development over the next year eight months is going to be be dictated by whether or not he can force his way into this team because there is an argument that for all he's clearly done really well if Elliot had stay maybe he would not have played that much football this season given how well the rescue M Field's done um yeah let me start at the beginning I think Lewis can be at this moment in anything he wants to be I think that the bar is that high for him um when I watch him in training as we do of course every day you see the level of player we have the challenge for him and I've said this many times is he's got a break into a Midfield of Sandra tanali Bruno jool Lon when he's fit Joe willick Sean longstaff you know it's it's a really good group of players and to get ahead of those starting players is is not easy but it will be a testament to his ability if he can and how quickly he can certainly doing self no harm by coming onto the pitch as he did against Manchester City and having the the strength in that kind of game to to Showcase his abilities um yeah I get your point um but Elliot broke into the team our team at the back end of last season and was really beginning to to show his level of ability his attacking level of ability that he has and and he's taken that on to another level partly because he's played every week of course um Lou is a totally different player to Elliott I wouldn't compare them both both um but Lou's got Stand Out qualities thanks Scott Chris you said that the made it clear to the players this week about what went wrong last week what does that actually look like in terms of I know you do a lot of analysis looking at the last game and looking at the opposition but if you have a real down performance like that how long do you Linger on it how are they made to watch you the entire game again like that sort of cliched sit and watch through the entire match what does that actually look like no I wouldn't sit them make them sit sit down and watch the whole game because I think that's sometimes negative I'm a big believer in on toone meetings um being very direct with what I like and what I don't like and that that works both ways by the way that's just not negative moments that's in positive moment so very direct feedback um and then of course there's a time for when the whole group needs to hear certain things so we've done a bit of both this week okay thank you Martin morning Eddie um as the next set and a half you fancied facing Chris straight after he did his hacker wonder where that was going then uh yeah I never shied away from a challenge as a player but uh probably looking at the level I played at I'm not sure I'd Fair too well against Chris and you've used that phrase already um is it bit of sweet that both Chris and Elliot have been so crucial in creating a Champions League chasing rival yeah not not so much for Chris I think but definitely for for Elliot because different stage of his career and Elliot wasn't a player I've said many times that we wanted to lose so um it's always a difficult one with X players because I always wish them well especially players that give everything for me in my time you can you can't not wish ex players to go on and further their careers and enjoy the rest of their their time in the game but now we're competing against them so of course we want to win thank you what K Jordan yeah morning um you know these players very well but I imagine you're making assessments every day still how important is it for them to continue to impress before the summer before the summer was the last yeah yeah they have to impress every day that that's their job so you can't live off past performances I very much have to take my eyes for what I see every day and make daily assessments to then lead to the next game and I've always lived by that and then we move on to the next game and making those assessments again so um I think there's big motivations at the moment for the players to do well we have big games coming up I'm sure all of them want to be involved in those games so I think there's a lot of sort of good opportunities for them to prove that they want to be in the team and stay in the team and does it feel this season that there's maybe a spot open for a forest or a Newcastle to kind of disrupt yeah I always think there's a there's a spot for us I'm not not any other team there's a spot for us for sure if we want it enough and we're good enough um the opportunity is there thanks K Jordan does does this game have a big game feel to it and can that benefit your players well if it doesn't there's something wrong it's a massive game for us um teams above us in the in the league we're chasing Nottingham Forest down they've had a a brilliant season so um if we don't look at it that way there's a problem uh we can't underestimate the challenge this is a huge game go morning Eddie you've touched on the new contracts of your players two your most experienced players in the squad you've got several other players out of contract your most experienced in oldest players looking at the medium to long-term future of your squad how important is it to find that balance between experience but then also bringing the average age of the squad down yeah it's always a a big thing I think when we first came to the club there was a big um group of players who were um in the just in their early 30s and that that's always a problem if you if you're outnumbered in any way too young or too old it can create long-term problems so there may be a readdressing of that as there was always a readdressing of that because players get older unfortunately um so yeah we're constantly looking at at Youth and potential new signings um but of course there is a place a big place for experienced players in the squad they they have to be there because they have been there and done it and they can lend a lot of experience on but they also set the culture and then usually the big leaders in the group as well so um we have to get that balance right
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,0L-r15o7F9s,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0L-r15o7F9s,good morning Eddie morning firstly uh want to ask you about Lloyd Kelly who yesterday last night completed his move to Juventus on loan with the obligation to buy why did you decide to let him leave yeah I don't think it was necessarily I get the question but I don't think it was necessarily you know my decision to let him leave I think it's very reluctant from our side because um Lloyd a player that had just recently signed and um you know we believed in him and his qualities um slightly frustrating for him that he hadn't played more um but in part really due to the form of the other players around him um but I think we're in the world um and we have been this window of trying to manage PSR and trying to make decisions that um benefit us in the long term and this is one of those decisions uh so Lloyd leaves with our best wishes he's certainly um exemplary attitude in his time here I'm sure he do well in Italy and it's exciting new challenge for him when I said you I meant you as the club not necessarily you personally um just clear on the art Riser yeah um it sounds like it's another one of those decisions that you've talked about this month or you've been asked questions about where it's sort of business and and finance over football again yes it yes it is I think um I said right at the start in the build up to the window that it was not a case really of looking at incomings it was a case of trying to manage outgoings really and trying to not weaken the squad to a point where the team's affected but we also future plan and make sure that we control everything in terms of our PSR level so I think we've done that I think it's been successful in that side I think um the two sales the the two players go with our best wishes they're two great Lads um the squad now is lighter in numbers um but high in quality so I think for us managing injuries ETA will be a big part of what we do now um in this part of the season coming up there's still no reason why we can't be successful um but yeah hopefully the future looks a little bit brighter for us round the corner and you say lighter in numbers there but nobody else left how important was that whether they were big names star players or Fringe players that nobody else departed yeah of course from my side I think we want a competitive team on the pitch and I know everyone one feels the same way and um you've always got a guard you look we've got I think two injuries at the moment um with Callum coming back and Harvey barel out and Jamal ourselves out um so we don't have sort of a huge burden of injuries at the moment but we still have a tight Squad so that's why I say that that managing that with the games we have to come is going to be hugely important to us we need to try and um keep everyone that we have fit and available remaining that way so we can um be competitive for the remainder of the season looking ahead to the match 2-n up after the first leg at the Emirates Stadium but is your message that this tie is not over I think my message is uh look we're at the halfway point of the tie I think it's um you the the away game was a good performance from us but of course against any opposition um The Game's still very much alive and we have to do our part but I think then when you add the quality of Arsenal and what they um the team that they have we know very much we have to be on our guard I think we just have to approach the game in a really um positive way aggressive way we have to very much try and be ourselves in every moment um there'll be no deviation from that from our perspective uh front foot performance at home we need to engage the crowd um we're in a good position um and we need to try and make uh make the most of every opportunity and finally you have done that against the top teams throughout your time here haven't you in this season you've beaten Arsenal twice the away leg and also at home in the Premier League um when you've had these big matches often it's brought out the best in your team hasn't it historically yes and I think that I think that's been a combination of us and the crowd I think we've become a really potent team together um and I think that's what we're going to need in this game we're going to need to absolutely um engage all our supporters in our energy and our body language and um every Power that we possess to involve them in the game because we need to make this um a really formidable environment for our opponent we need to create um really positive energy between us it's our duty to do that and we'll try to do that thanks Raz Keith Eddie how's the how's the overall feeling the overall mood sort of in the camp after the weekend because it felt after the Bournemouth game that that was perhaps a one-off but I'm guessing there'll be disappointment on on your part that there was another home defeat yeah definitely disappointment I think very little time to dwell on that defeat Keith I think it was one of those moments where we of course we analyzed it and reflected on it but then very quickly at to move forward we had a game in midweek which is a good thing for us to put that game away and and focus now on the future bright future hopefully for us a massive game massive um incentive uh for us to go into this game in a in a a clear head and I think that's what we needed so yes we learned the lessons and we know we could do better we're very much now focusing on this one is there any any concerns over the the home form because it felt like you were you were getting back to a strong position there you've lost the last two and and additionally there's a an evening game against Arsenal in a cup semifinal does it have a a different feel about it than perhaps a League match at home yeah I think it's a one-off game I think we need to approach it that way it's not um I do think it's a quite unique circumstance so I think for us the Premier League takes a back seat we then move on after this game to the FA Cup so um we will address of course a couple of things that we need to improve but I I don't think deep analysis in this moment of time is what we needed I think it was right what do we need now in the next game um and then we'll come back to that at late today you mentioned um managing the the injury situation How is how's Joe Lon after the after the weekend yeah Joey was um after the game putting a knee brace um just as a precaution he's out of that knee brace now um will assess how he is for this game I'd say he's a doubt uh but we give him every every minute we can to try and make him fit if he is a doubt look at obviously brings something different to your team but in that position he plays he feels you got good options at the moment yes we do in our Center Midfield um got good strength and depth in that position currently with um obviously Joe willick sha longstaff Louie Miley um three quality players will bring something slightly different but three quality players that can step in obviously jolon is unique and u that's why we give him every chance to be fair I know you you probably won have decided your team yet but in what um condition is someone like Louis Miley to come in and play if selected he certainly looks really strong in that that Cup match against Bromley played a few weeks ago yeah Lou in a I think I think in a great place I think he's been in in that place I think for a while he's trained regularly he's built that momentum that you build from from the training that we deliver um I think his performances have been really good very happy with him but very happy also with sha um how he's training behind the scenes uh and Joe willocks got outstanding attributes he played against Arsenal previously and did very well just finally for me you said a moment ago that the hopefully the future looks a bit brighter around the corner with regards to the I'm guessing you being the transfer window in the summer what can a a sale of someone like Lloyd Kelly to Juventus for the the money you've brought in what can that do for you in the summer in terms of what you able to do in terms of bringing players in spend I I think I've said many times it's it's quite it's a difficult thing to give definitive clear answers and that's not me being difficult um as to what the future looks like but I think certainly the last the last year we know we've been managing um a situation that we had to be um make decisions as I've said many times before that we wouldn't have necessarily made from a football perspective but hopefully by being prudent and making good decisions now the future we won't be making those decisions we've be making purely football based decisions when we get to that point I can't give you a definitive date um that would be wrong of me to do so but I think everything that we're doing is trying to lead us to that point thanks Keith Mark morning Eddie um in terms of PSR and the the limitations it imposes on you um do you think you're now going to have to be a lucky manager regarding injuries with that sort of lighter Squad as as you mentioned uh yeah maybe slightly um because I think there's some injuries that there's nothing you can do about there's some maybe you can control a little bit more um touchwood I don't like talking about injuries too much but I felt I had to mention it because um the situation that we now find ourselves in with the the lighter numbers that we spoke about but I think yeah hopefully this season's been been pretty good in that respect hopefully it can stay the same and um Arsenal obviously they'll be flying after the confidence-wise after the Man City win but how do you think they're going to approach the game sort of goingo from the start or do you think it's going to be a bit like a chess match in the first half I think you'll see two teams impose their try to impose their Style on each other I don't think Arsenal tend to change too much they're uh a strong team in most departments they've got um you can see against Manchester City in their last game the quality that they possess I thought they played very well so but I think both teams will be themselves or try to be themselves uh and try and win the game uh and we need to be ready for that and tomorrow it's apparently the 14th anniversary of the famous 44 draw between Newcastle and Arsenal soate um this really could be quite low scoring I suppose with with wat at State well who knows that's the beauty of football so you you never know you can prepare a game you can plan a game in your head and then the reality can sometimes look totally different but we need to be ready and adaptable for for whatever the game brings we need to bring our experience to the game as well I think um lots of different phases of this game we're going to have to be very good in the the worst aspects of social media were obviously brought back into uh into the spotlight with the comments about Joe willick I mean what advice are you giving your players regarding social media I mean staying away from it doesn't solve the problem but do you think uh it's not a bad plan with the sort of season entering the difficult phase it is what to stay away from it you mean social media yeah yeah as you say I think in this day and age it's difficult for players if that's been their life to to suddenly leave that environment um certainly from my side having never entered it I think it's quite easy to stay away from it and um that works for me but everyone's different and I think that we don't want to see those type of comments I think it's I thought Joe handled himself in a in a brilliant way I have to say um but I'm sure those comments would have hurt we hope to eradicate them from the game totally and from social media um moving forward but all you can do is report it and um conduct yourself in the right way that's all you can do thanks Mark got to Damien Ian and then George Eddie you've been very clear of the impact of uh PSR and um what it's meant over the last few windows and nobody would argue that there isn't great quality in the squad but since June last year you you for bodies down on on what you were and by most metrics that that has weakened the squad how frustrating and difficult is that from a coaching point of view when you're trying to build a team yeah I think that there's challenges there's challenges to every every situation you'll find yourself in as a coach um whether you're buying players whether you're selling players each has its positives and each has its negatives um I've spoke many times I think the challenges that sort of the last few Windows has given us and I think we need to always try and navigate away from the problems and try and find a different place to control our thoughts really because these things can sometimes act as a for you and I think that's how very much how I'm trying to pull the group together have real unity in smaller numbers um and we we keep fighting in every phase um and sometimes that Unity can be really really powerful so I don't think it's ideal um we'd love to have brought new energy into the group that that's being very honest uh but that wasn't to be our world in this window so we have to make the best of the situation just looking at at the game many of your players went through the ex SEC sorry excitement of the semi-final two years ago the disappointment of the final after that how useful is a experience in what you've got ahead of you tomorrow yeah I think it is useful I think um we can draw on those experiences that we had in the the semi-final against Southampton wasn't simple um I thought we played well actually in both games but it wasn't a simple passive there's there's certain hurdles we had to navigate in in that game of course the final was a different experience but I think we can still look back to it and can help us in these moments we had the Champions League campaign as well all those all those experiences you go through so I do think the group is has got the Armory to to deal with different um moments that can happen we got a lot of experience in the team players whove played in big games hopefully we can utilize that if we need to thanks D Ian morning Eddie morning you mentioned how yourselves and the supporters a very potent team together but if my own family and friends have anything to go by there's an awful lot of nerves ahead of the game within the fan base and that could transmit itself understandably in the early stages how do you ensure that if there is anxiety in stands it doesn't spill over onto the team well we certainly don't want your family anxious so um if they need a phone call from me then uh that yeah no I think I I think the supporters and and everyone connected with Newcastle I'm sure there'd be a range of emotions we're all feeling but I think you have to channel those thoughts and what I've tried to to do with the players is channel those thoughts into excitement these are the games we want to be involved in I don't think we want to look at it any other way what an opportunity for us um and I'm not talking about necessarily the score line leading into the game just the game itself it's a game we're going to try and win um and I think that's our best way to attack the game just look look at it purely as a a one game opportunity to get to a cut final when you won the first leg two two nil there was kind of a feeling that that would be very very difficult for any Wayside to come to St james' Park and U and win since then of course Bournemouth have uh beaten You by three clear goals can in a strange sort of way that game act as a to help you in that you know that if you are below your best against a very good side then they can thump you at on home s that's one way of putting it um I think you have to use any experience so yeah the Bournemouth game the Fulham game I think they were useful reminders for us not not that I need it that the level is so high in one mistake can cost you in a game so um we're going to have to be really diligent we're going to have to be very good on the small details as we always say and I'm talking set plays here really important part of the game every every part of the game we're going to have to be on top of our game which we weren't in those respective defeats that you mentioned um useful reminders for us but this is a new game and we have to be very positive going into it thanks George uh Craig and then Lee Rider morning Eddie morning um the cliche is that 2-0 is the most dangerous lead in in football do you agree with that cliche and what how has the lead informed your messages to the players your preparations your approach to the game if at all yeah I mean I said that's a probably a a conversation and for another time because I think you could go in depth on that I think the two-nil scoreline in itself would we want to be in this position yes um is it a dangerous score line it's only dangerous if you don't perform so for me the message is we have to we have to perform we have to be ourselves and we have to be all the good things about Newcastle when we're playing well that that's the challenge and I think if we are then hope everything else takes care of itself so focusing too much on the score line and the Dynamics of that I don't think it's healthy for the brain so just think a clear head let's attack the game in our way and then the other side of it is that Arsenal away did feel kind of very clinical same about the quarterfinal you've um answered questions about this before there was no dressing room Victory photo at Arsenal draining emotion from this cup run feels like it's been something that's been a very deliberate policy how have you got about doing that and why is it important I think sometimes I think you can build the game up unhealthily um what we've tried to do this season is approach every game in the same way um every game's important every game is it's a bit of a cliche at this stage but a cut final for us um we talk preseason training games we don't want to see a big change of emotion or big change in attitude towards any game when you're representing ing a club like Newcastle I think you have to understand the enormity of every match and take pride in um in everything that you're trying to do to to try and win that game that's what we tried to do and we won't change that approach now so yes we know the magnitude of the game but we have to approach it in the same way that we have for every other game this season you Lee Dominic and the Louise Taylor oh sorry Craig sorry Craig morning Eddie uh we we spoke last week about the sale of Migel almeron putting you the right side of PSR and then it being a necessity to that end did the subsequent exit of Lloyd Kelly then give you a little bit of scope Headroom to do something this month with regards an incoming and if so was a decision then it had to be taken not to do that no no that didn't give us any uh positive headro to bring a player and we we we knew from the off with this month we weren't in the incoming Market it was was about controlling some sales that um navigated us out of a problem so that's where we were the whole month and it never changed and just quickly on Callum is say you going to be back tomorrow Callum uh there's a there's a chance so we've got another important training day today let's get through training before we make a decision on him thank you thank you we got to Lee domic and Lise Eddie on the the whole situation in general what what happened yesterday are you frustrated that you weren't able to to bring a player in this month no I don't think frustrate is the right word because we've been planning and looking at numbers and opportunities for for weeks and weeks and weeks so frustrated yesterday no because that was a long time in in the making really the window ended probably how we expected it to at the start um so no different emotions for me I think overall an element of frustration that we haven't taken the squad forward in a positive way because I think that's that's everyone's aim and ambition when you go into a transfer window but not sort of frustrated yesterday on the day if that makes sense it's more of an overall feeling that we're we're very keen to try and take the team forward and progress and try and improve and get better uh obviously we haven't been able to do that this window and obviously there's lots of stories now saying that you're going to have 80 million to spend 100 million to spend you're saying that there's no set figure in that you know you're going to have to build longterm PSR wise that that feels like the answer unless they change the rules of course that' be nice if they if they could um but I think for us no that there's no set figure I know people have said all sorts of things War chest and all yeah it doesn't quite work like that I think um we're we're still in a position where of course we're communicate and discuss what's going to happen in the next window but that that's not now for a few months just on the game obviously the fans are going to have the scars with them they're going to try and create an environment for the team on the other hand Arsenal will also be looking for that early goal as well what how do you look at the strategy in a game where you are two n up and both teams could do with an early goal yeah but I think we've been we've probably had mixed success with that this season in terms of our starts to games I think we've had some very good um in our recent run of wins I thought we were starting the game really really well and back to the levels that we maybe were in our Champions League season a couple of times this season we've been frustrating where we we haven't started in the in the Right Way start to this game is going to be really really important um as it is to any game we need to set the right intention we need to set the right body language for for everyone to connect with who's coming to watch us I think if we can do that with the qualities we have that will help us a lot D morning Eddie just on the Lloyd Kelly transfer just how did it come about from your perspective because he was obviously on the pitch on Saturday and then an hour later that story sort of broken it all happen very quickly from there yeah probably similar to how it broke to everybody else um hearing things through the the correct channels that um there's an interest in Lloyd and it's getting to the levels that the club will listen to um obviously regarding Saturday I was treating Lloyd like I would any other player and trying to make the best decision to help us in the game and Sven botman return from injury mat targets return the former Dan bur Lewis Hall does that make the loss of Lloyd Kelly more palatable even if you were reluctant to losing yeah I think um our defensive strength I think is an area of the squad that's touchwood at the moment pretty good um obviously we have Jamal LEL still working his way back to Fitness he's still going to be a few weeks behind where we are currently but yes I think that um that strength and depth will help us obviously we have a couple of left-sided Center halves that you've mentioned there that are really strong and playing well but obviously it takes away a little bit of our depth and leaves us stretched if we get any injuries okay got to Louise Martin and then Luke hi hi um have you had conversations with the with the ownership in Saudi Arabia direct conversations explaining the whole PSR situation and the strategy for this window and if so does that explain why you're very measured why you're not throwing your toys out of the pram which many managers in situation in this context could be uh no I haven't had Direct conversations with them that's for other people to do and obviously I speak to people directly involved um when I need to I think if you did react like that in the modern world then I don't think your managerial Reign would last too long because you've got to work with the club in every moment there's no point me working alone for my own objectives the club has to act in a certain way currently with the financial climate this isn't the club's issue or the owner's issue this is the rules and regulations we're trying to comply with so um I've got to work on behalf of the football club in all moments good and bad um and that's what I'm trying to do and and finally um two nil is is a stereotype dangerous lead um has the psychologist been involved or be involved in talking to the players about they handling it no I don't I don't necessarily think that will happen I think but definitely my messages uh and the coach's messages really important to try and mold and shape our attitude to the game and that's the the key thing I think sometimes you can over over egg these things I think the players know what we need to do we need to perform well we need to play well and we need to try and win the game Martin more Edie um it's difficult isolated but where do you rank that Arsenal first leg Victory amongst your best results here um yeah I answer this question a lot Martin you you realize I don't sit at home trying to rank these things um I've got better things to do yeah I don't tend to do that believe it or not uh it was a good performance I was pleased with it um especially at a ground that we haven't done particularly well at so that was a nice a nice feeling but it counts for nothing because now you go into this game and you start all over again really and I think that's important that we we try to have that mentality and there is a sense of nervous nervousness around the city how is your mood and how important is the crowd my mood's good I'm recovered from the weekend's game which was hugely disappointing and always takes me a while to recover from defeats because I like to absorb the feeling I like to then analyze and try and figure out what went wrong and and why it went wrong and then try and put it right I've always gone through the same process but I think then when you come out the other side of that you look forward to this game and you think this probably a great game for us to come out of that defeat planning and preparing this exciting opportunity and those well that nervousness that you describe obviously I'm not aware of or open to but I think those nerves should should quickly hopefully for everybody connected with Newcastle turn to excitement and what could be and I encourage that to be the case so in last one you you seem to be touching there upon the unity that can happen when a club has a difficult Moment Like selling players not buying players are you unex ly going back to some of the techniques you in the early days from Bournemouth here yeah what you say not necessarily going back to those techniques but that that method and that thought that with less players if I if I go right back to my my second season in a transfer embargo for a season with the same players that we entered a relegation battle with if I had a different emotion or an angry emotion or you're wasting so much energy and it's actually working counterproductively against your players you've got to embrace everything your situation you got to embrace it and you've got to try and figure out how to get the best out of it so that that's not changed that that method um for me is the best thing whatever situation you're in try and make the best okay few to go we've got Luke Kieran and Don there's been talks of nerves and apprehension and things like that but what what Newcastle as a football club have waited a long long time to be in these situations to be in cup semi-finals this is surely one of the great occasions to be a newcast United manager and a newcast United player yeah absolutely and I think that's what I was trying to get across in my answer to Martin I think nerves and excitement they're closely linked to each other as emotions and I think you have to try and focus on that side the positive side much more than the sort of the negative side and I understand the brain can go in different directions but I think ultimately when you when you look at this game and you go what we're in a cup semi-final what what a great opportunity we've got and that's if it's nil nil so forget any talk of a lead it's nil nil what a great opportunity for us at home to um attack the game and try and embrace everything that we're facing and do our best and that's what we're going to try and do is this also a game for your star names to prove once again because they have done it that they are big Big Time Players Big Game players players who can you know Define these Great Moments these historical moments yeah I think it's a case for all the players not just the big name players that you mentioned it's a case for everyone that enters the pitch to show they can rise to that occasion that they can leave a legacy on the pitch that they can do something in a moment that everyone talks about for years and years you know what a great position to be in all this St just finally loss of form that sort of stuff comes up You've Won 10 out of 12 you're actually in a pretty good place aren't you yeah I think always with these things it depends how you look at it what your Viewpoint is is if your Viewpoint is negative you'll look at two losses out of three in the league if you viewpoints positive you'll go 10 out of 12 so it all depends what angle you're coming from okay just a moment left can we go Kier just single questions and then Dominic please uh morning uh Newcastle trishing up in great sellers do you think trading has to be the way forward now trading is probably the most important shortterm way without a new stadium and all the other things that we've discussed many times trading takes on huge importance I'm not going to go on the history of Newcastle was trading but just in the last few windows it's it's um it's not been clear and easy for us to navigate our way through this situation um so yeah we're trying our best to comply with the rules thanks Karen I'm sure I just one when when will the club get clarity as to how they can approach the summer window well I'm sure when the dust are settled from this um there'll be a way forward and I'm sure we'll have discussions in the coming weeks
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,XPjOEU1PAmI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPjOEU1PAmI,good morning Eddie yesterday the club announced Miguel almeron had completed his move back to Atlanta United um what can you say about the player and the person that you've let go yeah very special player very special person he's going to be greatly missed by by everyone connected with um with us I think uh migy was what you saw the perception of him was was real very um bubbly bright um personality but I think behind the scen very very professional like Ultra professional always be in recovering looking after himself eating the right Foods doing everything he could to beat his very best every day and I think you can't have enough from my perspective you can't have enough of those players that set the right standards in terms of behavior I thought he's a really good uh role model behaved really well so going to be greatly missed um as a as a person and of course a player he gave you some Great Moments and some huge goals uh during your time as manager and prior to your arrival as well um considering where you are now how important are the efforts and the the contributions of players like that in getting you to this point yeah I think you always look back with fondness of people that have have given their all really and I think Mig is one of those personalities and players that always gave his best in any moment good and bad um and then he had ability I mean the goals he scored in that Champions League season will be remembered for for a long time I think the PSG goal naturally will get the attention but there's lows during that season that propelled us to a a brilliant season the season before and um yeah to see him score the goals that he did and get in the Rhythm that he did and the the vein of form where he looked like he was going to score every game he played really well with the players around him I remember great relationships with with Shawn and with Kieran and uh yeah special time January is a difficult month to do deals in but how important for Newcastle was it to get a fair deal for him given his age and his profile yeah yeah of course you people are negotiating behind the scenes um and I think it's a deal that suits the club and and Suits migy I think it's a good time for him to get a fresh Challenge and Club obviously that he knows very well he's got a great relationship with so I think he goes into very good hands the other way but as I've said many times this month it's a deal that we needed to do um um it leaves us you know a little bit short in the respect of that position that that migy played and attacking areas currently while Harvey's injured and callum's injured we're certainly stretched in that area but um it was a deal that we needed to do a few other Newcastle players have been linked with moves away this month do you expect any further outgoings before Monday night uh as we stand now I I currently I don't um but yeah things can change but as we stand at the moment I expect the squad to remain the same you mentioned Callum Wilson and Harvey Barnes there two players who are on their way back from injuries where are they in their respective recoveries and is there any chance for this weekend no chance for this weekend Callum is getting there um he's we have seen him in training this week will be in a not the whole session but parts of it and he look good but no the plan is not to involve him this week but there's a chance for the games following um Harvey is a little bit behind I think he's going to be probably within the next two to three weeks just a couple on the match this weekend the table firstly is still really tight if you win and other results go your way you could be third um which I guess shows the opportunity that's there for you this weekend how do you view the the race for those top positions as it stand with 15 games to play um I don't know I've not really studied it um in probably the the length you have I think when you're preparing the next game it's always about just trying to maximize the match and knowing that the league table will always take care of itself I you know of course I've seen it and I know it's tight and I know um as always the next group of games are going to be important as the games drop down and and you lose you know 15 doesn't sound a lot and you get into the last 10 games and it um obviously every result takes on huge importance we know we're in a a run of games where we've been doing well and we need to try and keep that going as long as we can and earlier in the season fham beat you 3-1 at Craven cottage which was a tough day for you but I suppose shows just what a good team they can be so you'll be aware of the threats they carry yeah it was a tough day we didn't uh perform anywhere near like we can and we we know that that was a a phase where we were struggling to reach our best form but you know in the Premier League that um every team has really strong um qualities and I think on the day fulam played very well I think they fully deserve to win and we learned a lot of lessons from that from that game that we tried to take forward and we're still trying to take forward and improve our game um very good side very good manager very well coached thanks Ros Keith Eddie you said there that um the migy sale was a deal that you you needed to do does that mean you're in a position with just a couple of days of the window to go that you you you can't now go and add did you did you have to sell him with the inability to to bring someone in yeah we knew this this window barring a you know something huge happened that we didn't expect would be a window that we didn't recruit in um said that right from from the outset and despite being linked with numerous players that's that's still the case uh we're not actively looking to bring players in um but hopefully the squad's in a you know a decent place if we can get Callum and Harvey back um fit and firing within a few weeks I think the the squad will look good obviously the they're not back yet and it you know it might take a few weeks to sort of bed them back in are there concerns on on your part that you are a bit light in the forward areas I mean you look at right wing you've only really now got Jacob Murphy as a as a specialist right winger if you like yes um it's it's probably not ideal for us in this moment to be uh be like in that position but it it is what it is and I've always said I've got no problem dealing with what I know um and trying to make the best of the situation so we'll look at Solutions and um players in different positions if we need to um that's my job to try and find a solution if that happens you've got two big uh home games coming up in the next few days and and you said after the Bournemouth game a couple of weeks ago that the players looked looked fatigued due to the the schedule does that mean that um if there's any of that fatigue still around does that mean that going into these two huge matches you might have to sort of mix things up at all in terms of your your team selection I think the Bournemouth game is unique I think we had played on a Wednesday night we were kicking off at 12:30 on the Saturday I just feel for that game we we just hadn't recovered from from the game beforehand then going into the B I think everyone could see that we were visually a little bit reactive in that game but now we've had we've had time since then we've had two three weeks I don't see fatigue being an issue at all um we're desperate to play and very keen to play well um so no I don't see that being an issue one of the positions you look very strong at the moment is in is in goals you've got Nick PB and he was on the bench last weekend Martin's done brilliant in his absence have you got a a decision to make now as to who is your your number one moving forward in in the short term yeah I understand the question and the the Intrigue into sort of trying to get me to name a number one but but I've always said and even when Nick was playing regularly in goal these things are always there to to be changed by the performance of The Players um you never really want to say well that's that's the player that plays in that position all the time you want them to be challenged and and ask questions by the players around them so we got healthy competition in there we've got healthy competition in our backline um and hopefully that will serve us well can I just throw a bit of a left field one at you if you don't mind we're asking all managers today um on the back of the the abuse that Michael Oliver and his and his family received um what do you make of referees and and how they deal with these situations I know you're you're one and you've said a number of times in the past on the touch line you try not to get involved in anything you keep your your thoughts to yourselves but um how important it is that that the managers players and everyone involved in the game shows a good example so we don't see any incidents like what we've seen over the last couple of weeks yeah I think it's vly important because I think and I know from having children myself that the younger generation look and copy the copy Behavior so see it on a touch line on a Sunday all the time you'll see what we do in the Premier League transferred to Grassroots football and I really feel for the referees in some situations who Who Do It For the Love of the Game really and then they're getting abused so I think we want to see all that kind of behavior Stamped Out of the game we want people to be able to enjoy the game in a friendly safe environment and um I can't back that enough thanks Keith Andy well Eddie uh we'll get the big question out of the way first who's replacing migy smile in the dressing room and is he one of those footballers that You' you've never seen anyone Smile as much as he did throughout his career at Newcastle yeah I don't think you can replace that smile easily I think um I think that's what everyone loved about migy I think they could see his positivity and you as I said earlier as a manager when you're controlling or trying to manage 30 senior professionals and trying to produce a changing room that um in the good times and the bad times always has a positive outlook you can't have enough of those figures in there so he's a big Miss in that respect of course he's a big Miss as a player as well but um I think we've got some really good um positive figures in that dressing room that will try and step up in his absence it might have got lost among some IG news but again nominations for Newcastle yourself as manager of the month Alex eak player of the month save of the month I think thing for Martin Deka as well uh are you getting used to these nominations these days to be honest I didn't even know until Lee told me a second ago so uh that's what it has uh I think the tunnel vision that I have in preparing a game but I think and I said to Lee on the way here that if you're nominated for these things on a regular basis hopefully it means you're having a good season absolutely uh we see it on the pitch how often do you see it in training this link up between Jacob Murphy and Alexander isach and how often do you kind of work on that link on not um I I don't know whether you see that those two players in isolation sort of in training more than any other relationship yes that you know they're producing goals for us which is a great thing and long may that continue for both players but I think with the way that we work we we do work continually on our relationships in all areas of the team and I'm a big believer in Partnerships um and not just Partnerships but working in threes as well to try and cuz I I'm a big believer that if you can make your partner play better you know you can help his career you can help Elevate him and the team so the way we train is always based around that and it's great to see two players having a a really good link up just finally uh game against Fulham tomorrow obviously first home game since that Bournemouth game a couple of weeks ago is there an attitude and a feeling amongst the squad of writing the wrongs from that day tomorrow um yeah I think we definitely had that feeling going into the sampton game we knew that we needed a big response the players gave that but I do think that you know that was an away game and you're coming back to the same environment where we didn't perform and we know we we felt we let ourselves down in that in that moment for all the reasons that we've given before so an opportunity to finally put that game to bed I think thanks Andy Nisha morning Eddie when you had have the biggest game of the season just a few days after this really important Premier League game how do you park that just to have this pure focus on fham or can you not do you have to think about potential fatigue in the squad it's weird I don't I don't look at it that way at all I don't look at that we've have the biggest game of the season ahead I as in the Arsenal game I the biggest game of the season for me I know it's cliched but is the game we have coming up um because it's the only one that we can affect and do something about so the Fulham game is taking all our attention every energy that we have um in the background we will be preparing of course what we need to do against Arsenal but that can wait for um the outcome of this game so all energy will focus purely on filam you said that you always knew bar something extraordinary that this wouldn't be uh window you recruiting has it been quite refreshing perhaps not to have a phone ringing all the time through January it's still been ringing but it's been ringing the other [Laughter] way um so no it's not been as I've said many times it's not been totally inactive for us but I think there's been a a general consensus that we're not actively looking for players but as I said many times we still need a knowledge of players you still need to build that of course for future future reference um I imagine it's been quite frustrating for you guys because that's a big part of what you want to know and um I've sort of slammed the door shut every turn but that that's because yeah as I said we've not really been looking Marco Silva said in his press conference that you know Fulham are hard to beat they aren't going to change their approach going into this game he touched on it before kind of putting the rights putting the wrongs right against Bournemouth I guess how difficult are you expecting it to be and what difference could be at home make yeah I think when you play Fulham I think every game we've had against f and they they've been good games and you can see their qualities um and you can see Marco's qualities in his team as well I think very good football team they're they're very brave in every aspect so they're Brave with the ball they're Brave without the ball and they've got some very good players I think their recruitment last summer was very strong I think they added some players that made them generally their team and their squad more competitive and we found to our cost against them um that strength sort of shone through in that game against us I thought they're very impressive so um we never underestimate um fham and we never underestimate any opponent but we know this will be a tough game thanks Nisha we go to Ian Louise and then Lee good morning Eddie have Newcastle benefited from not playing European football this season um are you alluding injuries you're talking here or just generally just the schedule and the fact that last season you know that fatigue became a factor yeah I think became a factor because of the number of injuries we had and I think yeah I think if you're you're linking it to injuries our injury record's been much better this year possibly and I said this before due to the schedule last year was intense for us and we once we had a few injuries we were chasing um in a negative way we could never get the balance right and then we're having to play players continually the same players over and over and over again every two three days and that that's never easy so in that respect yes but I think in some respects no we want you know we want the competition we want the games um uh I really really enjoyed last year although it was challenging I really enjoyed everything about it so I think it's a double-edged sword for us with would definitely want it again if we could and on a on a similar theme Eddie uh does this season have a similar feel to to two years ago when you didn't have European football you were through got through the semi-finals of the carabal and you were challenging for Champions League places in some senses yes um definitely I can see parallels there I think there's been difficult moments there were difficult moments in the in the Champions League season but ultimately one of some great runs and runs of Victories that propelled us up the league did well in the Cup competitions um I it's a slightly different feeling whereas That season there was just huge excitement and optimism and everything was new I think now everything's a lot more level um which in some respects is is good you know in a sense that don't think there's this huge [Music] um sort of unknown for us I think we're going into a period where we we we know and understand it a lot better than we did that year and I hope we can use that to our advantage as we go to the end of the season thanks Louise morning Eddie um I'm just wondering is industrial Espionage particularly with drones a problem in football people spying on training I was just looking at the Bev priestman case in Canada I don't know if you're familiar with it she was um a super talented coach she was Phil Neville's assistant with England women LED Canada to Olympic gold in Tokyo and then last summer last Summer's Olympics she was Canada were caught spying on opponents she's now serving a a one-year worldwide ban from football but I went through email exchanges which had been released with analysts that she was trying to employ one of them was sort of saying spying is not moral and she was kind of saying this actually is standard in men's and women's football and National associations clubs and then of course I mean I remember being at the at the leads game with with Marcelo beela and Frank Lampard when a rather more rudimentary form of spying Aya Man trying to hide in a tree um had been uncovered by Frank Lampard who went mad and B Ela you know was was puzzled because this was standard in in South America Etc um but I just wondered with you know drones now and technology is it something that you actively have to guard against or do you not think about it or I don't give it a second thought to be honest I think um I think we're quite isolated here to a degree I think uh if we were in a a different part of the world it might be a little bit more relevant but I think for us yes we use drones we use drones to film our training um don't think we've had an issue with any drones flying over from from somewhere else to potentially spy on us but and if even if they did I don't think they'd quite understand what we're doing anyway so I think it I think it would be irrelevant there's no anti-aircraft missiles around the training ground there's there's no um there's no plans if we need to obviously I'll uh I'll look at it and and finally um obviously be priestman who seemed to be going right to the top in in the women's game I mean Phil never said she could easily coach coach men she was top top talent um she does she deserve to be given a second chance I mean Bel Elsa it was just you know he sailed on and people kind of looked rather affectionately on it is is that a double standard or is it so serious that she she's finished I don't know enough about it to be honest to give a uh an opinion of any Clarity to go one way or the other first I'm hearing about it is your your assessment of it so I'll leave that to someone else thanks theise just a reminder on time hopefully shorter questions who go to the leag Yeah Eddie on um going back to what you said when you said you you needed to do a deal with with the migy thing is it is it now pretty much you're given that the summer window you will have access to funds and you you will be able to make cash signings um do you know what Lee I think that's a question for another day I I don't um we haven't sat down and had those conversations and and sort of a clear picture of our financial situation um obviously we did in preparation for this window um but everything has been quite shortterm and quite rightly because our focus is on what we can can and can't do this window and what we need to do and then obviously the summer window will look will look differently uh no doubt um but in terms of sort of the details of that I've got no idea at the minute just to clarify when you say you needed to do the deal because obviously you're going to be a player down now if you can't bring anyone in so can you just elaborate on why you needed to do it PSR related yeah PSR related um that's why we needed to do it uh and just on jaer Murphy obviously he's in fantastic form um he's whether he's in the England conversation or not I I don't know but do you think he deserves to be uh in contention for a for a call up given he been in the under 21s before and you know based on form players um in the Premier League he is definitely one of them at the minute I think Thomas will no doubt be be looking closely at all our players that that qualify um to play for England I think he's been at a number of games um so yeah I mean Jacob's in good form my message to him is to just continue in the vein that he has been he's been creating a lot of goals creating a lot of chances for the teams also could have scored more himself he's been unlucky a few times so um Great Character great lad I really wish him well and and hope he can carry on where he's left off thanks Le what a cig then Scott and Chris morning Eddie you've had a free week this week which was good in terms of preparation and fatigue but the sorry the elephant in the room midweek was perhaps all of the noise around the Champions League you know you guys weren't part of that that final match your top players however many fall into that bracket have given you one season outside the Champions League will they give you two do you think is it as simple as you need the Champions League next season to keep some of those names at the club um I I don't know I don't see it quite like you see it and have bracketed the question there I think that those players that you're talking about I think need to perform to sort of confirm that they you know they want to play there they want to play there with us you know that that's got to be the aim and the ambition not looking elsewhere the determination and resolve within the squad I I've seen in recent weeks has been very very strong I think we've been hugely motivated um we've put a great run together we've put ourselves in a great position but I think this is the important part of the season now we're coming down to the the the the games where we need to try and keep winning we need to keep the runner form we need to stay in and around where we are and really push so uh my message to them is to focus on that and just on that all the noise around the Champions League this week and I dare say you watch the games did it bring home that is where you need to be that is where you want to be definitely I think when you look at those games as from the outside and you you you you're having a totally different experience when you're the outside looking at the gamees as to when you're in it obviously when you're in it it's it's so fast-paced you're going from game to game to game it's um it's a great thing to be part of we're desperate to get back there and we we'd love to as a whole Squad Chris uh morady in terms of you said last week that ideally you would like to be signing at least one player per window and you said that maybe there can be a steal and you need a freshness to the squad how have you gone about trying to Pro avoid that knowing that you said that it was unlikely you going to do make a signing this window how have you gone about trying to prevent that Stillness from creeping in well I think to a degree internally that can sort of serve itself I think when you get players back from injury they are like new signing so when Sven came back there was a huge lift um hopefully touchwood we've got Callum and Harvey not too far away um jamala cell's a bit further back but not too far away they can be like new signings cuz when you're training as intensely as we do you're separated from the injured players there's nothing you can do about that and suddenly new energy comes back into the squad so I think that's how I've tried to look at a couple of players returning um big personalities can give you that boost to be honest there's no other way that you can fabricate that I don't think I don't think I can magic up a new personality um sometimes with young players coming up if they do well they can bring an energy and a freshness to the group but beyond that there's not a lot else you can do and just another one on Jacob Murphy I mean you've previously miguelon was was largely the the first choice right winger for a period Jacob Murphy has sort of come from behind in terms of that position within the squad and and really cemented that position over the course of the last few months how difficult is it for a player to do that and and how impressed you have you been by him doing that um yeah I I don't know I think two players fighting for the for the same position we've got that a lot within the squad at the moment is is a great thing and I think it's it's Up For Debate you know everyone goes oh what's your strongest team and you must know your strongest team and I I always say it's it's always in a state of flux because you never quite know form is a temporary thing and you really do want players to show their best form and their best moment to to challenge the person that's got the shirt and then that can easily change to to them owning the shirt and then you want a really good response from the other player and I think that's that's a really good team working or really good squad working together um to benefit each other so yeah migy and Jacob they fought for the shirt they shared minutes together migy went on a really good run of form in part because murf I think was was breathing down his neck he was fighting for the place um and then sort of Switched the other way this year to Jacob um nailing the shirt down and keeping his place and Miggy fighting and and training very well I have to say to to keep murf very much where he needed to be in terms of his performances so um now we're going to have to find another solution on the right there we're going to have to look at different ways that we can offer support and competition for Jacob trying to squeze as many questions as we can at the last few minutes so we'll start with Scott we'll go to to hi Edie um when you say you don't expect anyone else to leave does that mean in your mind the Martin Deka situation is completely put to bed now he he stays beyond the end of the month and if saw has Martin sought any assurances about what his longer term future might look like or have there been any contract discussions there yeah Martin won't leave um yeah we're in discussions with Martin about new contract I think I said that a few weeks ago hopefully there'll be a swift conclusion there um no he's not sort any um sort of uh certainties on his on his place or anything beyond you know just trying to stay on the team and do well and then just another player Beyond January will aula there's almost certainly going to be a lot of interest in him lawn deals things like that is that a bit of a double-edged saw because potentially could benefit from playing regular football he hasn't has obviously hasn't really had that but you might need him and there probably is a benefit for him to continue training within your first team group where do you see that balance yeah I see that balance very firmly at the moment and that he needs to be here with us he needs the training with us he needs the understanding he needs the development that we're trying to give him um will is a a multi-talented player as well I don't see him just being a pure number nine he he has played wide before so that is an option that we could look at um I think he's doing well he's on track he's he is developing um obviously he's looking at him as a striker he's competing with Alex for a place which isn't something you necessarily want to be doing uh at the minute with Alex's form but in some senses and and I said this to will when he signed he's learning off two of the best strikers that he could possibly work with currently and he needs to absorb as much information from both Alex and Callum um two great role role models for him to help him in his development so now very much here at the moment and of course Beyond this season we'll try and take the next steps that benefit will an us thanks Scot what B P Rebecca morning Eddie just to follow up on Chris's question about Jacob Murphy Miguel Al who do you view as your most natural alternative to Jacob Murphy in your side now Miguel and Ron's no longer there no one currently um I think we'll have to I don't think there is a natural player I mean that we'll look at a few different options jolson's played wide for us this season as I said willisa could possibly we we we'll have a look at that um but I don't think there's I don't think we have a huge queue of players that are naturally uh wouldn't necessarily Excel playing on the right but we'll we'll have to find a solution of course um and as I said we need support for Jacob Jacob's not going to be able to play every minute of every game so and we also need to push him so we'll look also at the Academy and if there's anyone in there that deserves an opportunity so uh we look at all options thanks Rebecca morning Eddie I just wanted to go back to the question before about um kind of does this season have parallels with a couple of seasons ago do you feel like your sort of better equipped as a manager and kind of managing the expectations for this kind of crucial four five month period with Caravel cup premier league and obviously doing well in the league champions league potentially being on the horizon well I think with every experience you have whether good or bad you hopefully improve from it if you analyze it properly um so I'd like to think season upon season you build that bank of knowledge and potentially can help your players in different ways I'd like to think so the reality is you you never quite know um you know try and push myself every day to to be there for my players in any way that I can be thank you Kieran morning it's very obvious question will you have to sign a right winger in the summer haven't lost one and do you think the groundwork you've done this month the research the the talks you've had can can benefit you going forward in the summer yeah I'd like to think so I mean unless someone comes from The Blind Side and surprises Us in that position I'd imagine that we would possibly look to sign someone in that position but um there you know I always say there's no guarantees with anything but the natural thing feeling would be that we'd need a replacement for migy eventually and finally there have been some big bids coming from the Saudi pro league that clubs have had elsewhere there was maybe a perception that Newcastle would benefit from that partnership uh it's not really proved the case has that made you smile a bit not sure smile is the right word um but yeah um looked on with interest really at the the the Saudi League because initially there was a huge outlay of transfer fees and wages for players from from England that seemed to really settle down last summer there was minimal activity I mean there was a few but minimal compared to the summer before and now there's sort of selective players that um are moving there and it's interesting to see how that League develops but yeah we haven't been the the beneficiary of many bids yet
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,EoVtB7R2jmM,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoVtB7R2jmM,good morning hi Rosa firstly has the storm and the bad weather had any effect on your preparations for South Mountain and your travel plans potentially the travel plans yeah we'll see how today goes I think our plan as always is to travel today um but we seek advice from the authorities in the airport and and everyone involved to whether it's safe to fly if it's not we could end up traveling tomorrow morning you would fly tomorrow morning and potentially rather getting the bus because that's a a long journey going on the team coach yeah it is a long journey and also there's no guarantee with the wind and um the conditions that what you think might be an 8 n hour Journey might turn into a 12 13 hour Journey so we've got to be careful I think in that respect so I think it's probably best that we we look to do that but nothing's guaranteed we we seek advice and try and make the right decision you've had free week in the sense there's been no midweek game has that been a good thing for you I think was a good thing initially because I think it gave us a chance to deal with some of the F physical issues we had in the Bournemouth game I think there's no doubt when you look back at that game and you watch it firsthand the players were fatigued and I think there was a a big element of that was the reason behind our performance so I think with the games that we had and when you look back to sort of the end of the week we had wolves late on Wednesday and then an early kickoff I think that um that just swung it against us really in terms of our physical outputs taking nothing away from from Bournemouth who played very well but yeah so it gave us a chance just to rest a few bodies um and minds and then come back and start work so have the players had a couple of days off at the start of this week before coming back in to to build towards South yeah some did I think we we manag tried to manage it against the players that needed rest and the players that needed work so we've tried to make sure that now everyone's on the same page and we should be fine going into the next game just want to ask you about a couple of players firstly Nick Pope who I think last week he said would potentially be close for this weekend is there a chance he'll be in the squad yeah there's a chance of being in the squad I think he's um started training with the group again and it's great to see Nick back in his presence and his positivity that he brings um seen him do some some really good things this week so yeah delighted to have him back in the mix and is still a bit too early for Callum yeah it's too early for Callum callum's still on track for I think the right at the beginning of February if my memory serves me right um he's making good progress he's we we're trying to do the right things with him and and make sure that he is robust enough and has all the work behind him and the load behind him before he starts um training with the group but he seems very positive and you know what a massive player that would be to welcome back finally a couple of questions on Southampton um take you back to the opening weekend play off southampt dominated possession 11 11 and then obviously but you won that match one which was a huge result for you to start the season yeah it was it was a really difficult game as we knew it would be because newly promoted team very um really uh possession based uh principles and you know we didn't start the game particularly well then you have the sending off and you there a real challenge for the players mentally then to regroup and still find a way to win that game was a great start to the season for us in terms of results um but I thought Southampton that day showed their qualities you know the very good technical team um they uh they made the game difficult for us but I was absolutely delighted as I say with how we responded to that moment and after a change of manager are they still very much possession based do you think or have they they altered their style of play I'd say they're they're more mixed now I'd say that there still definitely elements of that possession based play in their game um I don't think that will that will go away quickly because they've you know been trained that way for a long period of time and obviously the new manager obviously embracing that as well uh but I think you've seen definite changes in potentially structure and off the ball I think it's probably been the biggest change where you've seen a um a very aggressive man Forman style um off the ball which is something we're going to have to do well against and try and combat um I think they've been competitive in the games it's it's a very difficult moment for them because in the games they've been they've been in every one near enough um and have just ended up on the wrong side of the results thanks Riser ke skyports Ed with the with the the travel tomorrow if you H if you have to go in the morning what kind of impact could that make for your your preparations because we don't really see that much these days do we especially for a long journey like that most premier league teams at Elite level would would travel the night before if we could yeah I don't think it it changes too much to be honest I think that we've done it before ourselves we've traveled on the day for a say a 5:30 kickoff especially if the airport's close to the ground and sometimes that's the easiest way you're in and you're out um through a 3:00 kickoff that's that's slightly unusual but there something we just have to adapt to I don't see an issue with it and what about for for training today because it's obviously quite wild out there at the moment do you train as normal is is there a is there a danger to the players well it is slightly uh slightly windy I have to say I struggled to get in a second ago um no I think hopefully we can find a place that is sheltered enough so the ball doesn't deviate too much and we can actually train normally we do have a a dome that we use but it's whether that's safe because that that's that's the strongest wins I've ever seen here or felt here so um yeah fingers crossed we can train normally you mentioned a couple of the players there that um that I've missed the last few weeks Sven obviously started against Bournemouth last week but then was taken off at at halime how is he with his recovery and the fact that he's had quite a few games in a short period of time yeah it was a challenge for Sven and I think Fabby had been ill and he wasn't 100% fit um and then we had Sven who had done really I think he's been magnificent since his return but obviously that was a challenge for him and I thought he looked a little bit fatigued in the game naturally because he's been thrust into action which has been a great thing for him Min AAL time to think just straight back in and he's got to find his rhythm and by and large I think he's yeah been excellent in all respects but uh a challenging few days for him but that he's one player that we've tried to look after and he's had a bit longer to recover and Fabby now hopefully he over his illness as well on Miggy it felt last week um not through anything you said but just from what we're hearing elsewhere that he may have played his last game he could have been not on his way he's he's still here is there still a a chance he could leave before the the end of the window and where is his head at with everything at the moment I think mig's head has been very very solidly here um he's been brilliant in training this week I've seen no not not one moment where I thought oh you know I need to address this or speak to him or have a deeper conversation I think we're both aware of the situation yes there is interest in him from other clubs um there is potentially a chance he could lead before the window but until that moment and if that moment never arrives he's still a valuable member of the squad um we love him to a bits he's got a great energy and character that's never changed for a second he's been the ultimate professional and let's see what happens just finally from me looking at last week's game and and you kind of alluded to it there but are you confident from what you've seen this week and speaking to the players that last week's performance with such a big drop off given your high standards was a one-off are you were you confident that that is a oneoff yeah I'm confident it was a one-off I don't I've not seen us I think the closest game to that the season will'll be full him away um where we've dropped in terms of our overall performance levels Dro that far that you think there has to be a sort of a bigger reason the players were trying there was no issue on that side it's just we had I think nothing left to give in that moment uh and everyone collectively felt the same way which is very very difficult I think to then navigate the game and we were in it until the end and then the game got away from us in the last couple of minutes but I think we have to learn from it though I I think there will be games potentially when we feel like that again in the future we definitely had games like that last year in our Champions League season where you're running on empty going into the game but you have to find a solution and you have to find a way to still be competitive and there's loads of things we could have done better to to help us despite the fact we weren't our best thanks Keith Andy on Eddie I was watching the Galla get end at full-time whistle after full-time whistle on on Saturday and they were singing Eddie's black and white Army over and over again what did that show of support mean to you and the players despite the result in the performance on Saturday well it always means a lot Andy it always means that we're still United and I think United in Victory and defeat is equally important we try to sort of send that message all the time to to the to the group to the to the whole club really that good and bad moments we need to be there for each other and the the supporters have never let us down on that I think they've been absolutely magnificent I think they could also see the game in the way that we all saw it that the players were were trying we w at our best that's very very clear um we have to take responsibility for that but I don't think there was a lack of effort or or the any other negative thing that you can label at the Players it was just we had nothing left to give you were saying there about some of the players having a couple of days off we sat down with Tino liento in midweek and he said he felt mentally refreshed after he came back did you feel a little bit like that after what has been a you know it's been a it's been a TD run of fixtures hasn't it it's an interesting one for me I um I've become accustomed to playing the games and and really enjoying the games and preparing the games and everything that goes into that reviewing the opposition reviewing our performances so I don't really have a I personally don't think necessarily an issue with the mental fatigue I think it's more what we have to guard against is the the obviously the physical fatigue for the players but also their mental load as well which sounds funny but it's the the brain can sometimes dictate how it feels the body feels and we need to make sure that they're feeling free and and energetic when when playing you talk about Callum there and doing the right things to kind of ease him back and what a massive return it would be for newcast are you doing anything different around Callum to ease him back as you would have done previously or not well if we're not then more for us you know we have to we we're always trying different things trying to learn from previous experiences um and it would be same for Callum callum's trying new things um no no one should ever think that we're steam rolling into the same processes the same thought patterns and expecting a different result so um our main aim is to keep Callum fit and keep him on the pitch and keep him available to play because we know if he does he's a big player and he'll always score goals so I know that's what Callum wants and he's trying his absolute maximum he's doing everything he can professionally to um keep himself on the pitch and I'm sure everyone's United again in that support for him you know we all want the same outcome to see him back to his best be great to see him back as and when that is and just finally what sort of new Newcastle can the fans makeing the trip this weekend expect to see down at Southampton well as I said we need to learn from bourma so um that game stings it hurts and we need a response I've got no doubt the players will respond after that game um but there has to be a collective response from everybody and we have to go to Southampton absolutely focused thanks Andy and morning Eddie um by Common consensus Southampton aren't fighting for their lives any longer they're actually down does that um is that true and does it make them more dangerous opponents no absolutely not I I don't believe in that um it's a it's a game that we absolutely have to respect our opponent and we will in everything that we do in our preparation Southampton a very proud football club um obviously have a lot of experience of Southampton having played for both bourou um and Portsmouth so um very proud football club you know great club we have to be we have to be absolutely out our best I don't think we've ever had an easy game at Southampton they've always been very difficult um and they've got very good players as well so it's up to us to uh show our right mental qualities uh and you must be um aware that the the last two games they played actually very well didn't they against Manchester United and then uh their comeback almost comeback against Nottingham Forest suggests actually they are aggressive they're front footed uh possession base they're going to be quite a tough opposition well they are and that's that's why I said what I said if you look at the Manchester United game I thought they were outstanding for 80 minutes that's one of the best performances I've seen at Old Trafford they were Dynamic technically very good as as I said earlier um and a goal threat on the day and then against Notting and Forest now Notting Forest have had a magnificent season but at 3-0 down you would um at halim that that would have been a difficult moment for them but you saw their character they came back and could have arguably got something from that game as well can I ask about the Champions League it it looks increasingly likely that England will get that fifth Champions League place which obviously uh is great news for Newcastle um does the Bournemouth uh result in a way put that title um talk to bed and and the focus now is very much on winning one of those top five places finishing in the top five we've never talked about anything and I think that's important to remember um it's always there's always overreactions to everything so overreactions to winning overreactions to losing um created of course by outside influences I think for us we just have to focus on trying to win the next game um and find our momentum again find our rhythm again and we need need to do that very quickly uh the deoe published their list of um uh the wealth of uh the clubs around the world at Newcastle now 15th does that um Newcastle got money um clearly or turnover is increasing and that's incredibly encouraging uh does it in any way give us a clue about whether Newcastle could um be active in the transfer market before the window closes uh yeah I think that those things are always interesting to read and and and absorb I think we've got a still got a long long way to go and when you compare our revenue streams to the clubs certainly above us in that League table uh there's a big gap to fill um but certainly nothing's changed in terms of this window and my previous comments uh this month and finally for me um Fabian chair presumably is fit and available to play tomorrow so you have three fantast Central defenders in fantastic form you've got a decision to make there at at the center of Defense yes thanks Andrew D Lee and then Ian you talked earlier about the the mental and physical aspect of the fatigue last week I think we could all understand the physical side of it but how how big an imp in the mental side of things have particularly after the sort of run of fixed easy F yeah I think I we we looked a little bit what I meant by that is we looked a little bit cloudy in our in our thinking at the weekend um don't think we looked sharp with our decision making everything was a little bit took a little bit longer than it should have done and then we were getting caught um but I don't want to labor that point we didn't play very well we take responsibility for that um whatever the circumstances behind it you have to otherwise it can happen again and we have to move on from it quite quickly and just sorry to do it but just to go to PSR you would understand the figures better than us other the fans but can you but can you understand the frustrations of fans who see clubs like manchest City and Forest who perhaps have fallen fou of the rules being active in the market when you don't appear to be able to yeah I think that's a difficult one for me to go into I I wouldn't want want to talk about other football clubs I've never been of the opinion that I'm able to do that because I don't know their facts and their history I only know this one this club and I have to stick to commenting on us thanks D le Rider had he just done recruitment potentially in January is it fair to say you've got a position in mind if you could improve or have you got an open book basically no I've always said we have to do the work so we have to prepare as if we can recruit and I think that's the best way to be so we've done the work we know what we potentially would do we know what positions we potentially would recruit in but it's not for me to to talk here um but it's just so everyone knows that the work's gone on because I think otherwise you lose track of the market you lose track of players you lose valuable knowledge that you may need for the future so we've done all the work that we need just on the PSR game do you feel like the rules aair at the minute feels like a bit of an injustice that man city can just go out and spend 125 million just because they fell behind and like we at this position where we can't move basically that's doesn't seem fair yeah I mean I've commented a lot on the rules I I don't know what more I can add really to it I I've my my big thing is the incentive to sell your Academy products or the players that have a book value of zero that doesn't seem right to me when you put all that effort into the players and you guide them through various age groups the club and the coaches that the centers and the acmy invest that time that they're the players with the most incentive to sell I don't agree with that and there's probably a lot more I don't agree with but it's not the Forum to express it thanks Le Ian morning Eddie uh in a recent interview Sir Alex Ferguson said that while his memory of the the great Manchester United unit Fades he said he still remembers every detail of the big defeat and the heavy defeats is that the same with you yeah it is unfortunately um for some reason the brain seems to store those memories a lot more vividly and a lot more stronger and a lot more um with a lot more feeling than the the positive ones so we are could probably do the same um but I think that's healthy in a way as long as you harvest it in the right way it's it's healthy to help Propel you then to make sure that doesn't happen again the feeling that I felt on Saturday night just BAS around purely our performance not so much the result the performance is a horrible feeling that every manager will experience but it then forces you to do all the work and preparation training dedication to try and Escape that feeling for as long as possible and on the same masochistic theme you mentioned a few weeks ago oh please bring it on a few weeks ago you mentioned that on the trip back from brenford yourself and graem Jones you actually went through the entire match just an hour or two later was that the same last Saturday yeah it was yeah I had to watch it straight away so as soon as I got home um yeah great Saturday night for my family it was yeah me watching the game because I have to find what I think the answers are um for my own piece of Mind really so then I can enjoy uh enjoy what's to come so can you confirm your Mist uh yeah I mean I think I'm I'm a you know I like to face the reality I don't like to hide away from it so if there's s if there's a truth to be found if there's if there's something I need to expose just with my own eyes then I'll try and confront it I think as a manager when you're trying to lead a club of this size I think you have to try and face the truth sometimes and and not hide away from it thanks Ian of got a Craig Chris and then Luke Craig morning EDD you sat here last week and you warned of short-term pain I think we all knew what you meant by that with regards PSR and transfers did the subsequent game against Bournemouth expose sort of potentially a longer term issue in terms of you needing that Squad depth now not sort of pushing you see you've got to bring that in this month but longer term is there a real need there to have more quality and more players because at the moment you're working with a pool of 12 13 really at most you would say um yeah I mean I get your point I think it's a it's a difficult one because I think when you look at our our Squad at the moment we're sort of a little bit heavy on Defenders which is which is not necessarily a negative thing but we just the balance is slightly off you know our attacking players we've lost Harvey Callum and so now our attacking options from the bench in terms of forward areas is is slightly limited so I think that probably highlights the point you're trying to make a bit more I think we've got real quality and aot lot of positions um just maybe not in that Top Line and that of course when you're looking to make attacking subs and change the game they're the ones that you want so I think that's a slight issue for us but in terms of the quality of the squad and the quality of players we have I think we have 20 fit players at the moment yeah I think they're outstanding players and I think our squad's really strong I think the second point I want to make to your question is just freshness of the squad I think when you go consecutive Windows without freshening the group in a in any major way I think you run I've said this before you potentially could run into difficult Waters with stal oness and I think healthy rotation of the squad in terms of transfers in and out is important it's a slightly different subject as well plans are coming along with regards to the training ground now at Bournemouth you've said was previously you were all over those plans of a training ground you never actually got to to work in do you want to be involved this time will you be involved no I'd probably don't think I will be I think that will be for other people to to design I think you've got to remember the again the history of Bournemouth that was I was all over everything because there wasn't the infrastructure I don't mean that in a in a negative way there just wasn't necessarily the infrastructure at that club that there is here um so uh we gone from League 2 to the Premier League so you can imagine there was a lot of work to do to build the club upwards um this is a very different football club and I think with decisions regarding training ground and stadiums I'll be very much in the background probably hearing what's happening um with the experts involved and then you know hopefully looking on in a at what we're going to do thanks great Chris more Eddie you said there's still a chance that Miguel alron could go this window is that the same true with Lloyd Kelly uh I think slightly different situation with Lloyd um I've seen a a little bit of the speculation on Lloyd we've certainly not had any bid anywhere close to um making the club I think make a decision on that Lloyd's an integral part of what we're doing from my perspective um his challenge is to try and work his way into the team um he's only just arrived so I think he's got a lot to achieve here um so a very different situation and on that was it frustrating then to see uh an applo of an alternative Club who suppos you have an interest comment on Lloyd Kelly publicly well I think whenever your your players are talked about by other clubs I don't think that's ideal certainly I would try not to do that myself regarding players contracted to other clubs as well thank you Luke um completely forgot what I was going to say um are you effectively done for the window in terms of incomings is it is it from we can we say that now are you done I don't know how many times I've got to say it one more but I don't you think you're done but you you don't know you never say never so I'm not saying you'll be playing this back to me going well you said no um definitely would yeah uh but at this moment as we stand we've not been active uh in terms of income I only asked that CU I just it's just a message worth get I know you've said it but there still seems to be this idea that some you're lying or the player could come in later in the not you lying but there seems to be this IDE because the window's so quiet people are kind of building this narrative that clubs are just saying they're not doing anything and they're going to do anything but you couldn't be much clearer on it and have been since probably December yeah even further back I think look I'm certainly not lying um I'd never intentionally lie to the supporters and and try and mislead anybody we're not in a position to um be active in the market as we currently sit here now that might change if if something happens that's it thank you we'll go to Jordan Kieran and Martin mon just like Chris's question a lot of a lot of the noise around Lloyd is seems to be from the buyer side is that frustrating for you and is it unsettling for the player as well um it's not ideal but I I haven't seen Lloyd distracted I haven't seen a player that's head and heart is not in Newcastle which is really important for me if that was the case then I'd certainly be addressing that with him he's trained well he's fighting for a place uh and that's what I expect him to do the speculation around migy and Lloyd do you expect any more potential outo this month has been speculation around odysse Vos this week with Saudi Arabia as well uh so sort of attached to to Luke's question there are not ruling anything out in terms of players leaving but certainly not um you know our our core established players in the team but there might be movement in in certain other players thank you Kier morning uh the agent of uh Abdu Kadir kusenov said Newcastle were close to the deal but PSR played a part in that um how frustrating is that when obviously you're identifying players and you can't get it done I guess yeah I think it goes back to the question Lee asked me we've done the work so that's where I say we have identified players that we'd like to sign um we've spoken to the representatives because you have to be you have to do the process right if something happens and we are able to recruit um you can't then start from zero uh so yeah of course we're seeing players that we've identified and liked and targeted moveed to other clubs but that's always part of the game and with the restrictions you're facing do you think we'll see the owner's ambition really in in the infrastructure that you mentioned earlier the training around the stadium is that maybe where we'll see you know them come to the table Yeah I'd certainly like to think so I I think that's really important and I always say that about when you're trying to build a football club upwards and forwards the infrastructure is so important the training grounds where the players live dayto day that is that environment is key can help you recruit players it can help you keep players happy um we need worldclass facilities um if the club's Ambitions are to be realized and then of course that's Interlink with the stadium and our stadium is fantastic now and I I love playing there but if we are to improve whether that means staying or leaving what whatever the outcome um trying to um bring worldclass facilities here will be a game changer for us very tight for time we go Martin Dominic and Gary hi Edie just a very quick one you've touched on it already how hard is it not being able to strengthen your team or your squad in a window I don't think I don't think think it's necessarily hard but I think it's the challenge for us is when you go a long period of time I yeah as I said earlier I think that can bring you challenges not impossible challenges to overcome but but some hurdles I think you have to navigate I've always my wish has always been to try and recruit a a player every window to bring in that fresh face to boost everybody to increase competition loads of healthy reasons and and research behind that and we we've always feel that we've done well off the back of that now of course we did bring players in in the summer but um yeah did a different type of profile of signing and I think uh that's certainly a challenge for us thank you Don just on Martin Deka a few weeks ago you said there wouldn't be an official announcement or statement regarding his future can you just confirm that some form of agreement has been reached with him to keep him at least Beyond this current transfer win yeah believe talks have progressed well I'm not 100% sure where they stand right now but I think we're we're moving forwards together and with Nick Pope available for selection mon Deka as well what would be your message to both players heading into a important run of fixtures well I think it doesn't matter whether they're goalkeepers or any other position we need players performing at their best levels and I'll always pick the best one thanks D Gary to finish hi ready um obviously you mentioned there last Saturday he spent rewatching the match he probably rewatched it again just wondered uh what's the biggest thing you learned from last week and what's the thing you want to see improved most tomorrow I think whenever you see a game like that there isn't one thing if there was one thing it would have been easy to fix there and then it was a combination of things as I said earlier without repeating myself but it was definitely linked to our physical feeling um so I'd love to see that change this weekend I'd love to see us full of energy full of running sprinting all the things in the Hallmark really that we've done so well in the last group of games you could see physically we weren't we weren't there we were quite reactive I think in the game instead of being proactive so I think first and foremost before you talk about the Tactical and Technical elements of the game physically you've got to turn up at this level to win
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,8BhjW4AWcbk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BhjW4AWcbk,good morning Eddie um like to begin by asking about Miguel alaron because there's lots of reports and interest in him and ongoing speculation about his future what is the latest with alaron the latest is we expect him in for training today and to be part of our sad tomorrow is there still a chance that he could leave before the window closes uh yeah I'd say with him um currently that anything could happen from from this moment but my concern is to try to get the squad focused ready for tomorrow's game he'll be an important part of that I think the other day you praised Martin debka for the way that he has been conducting himself during a period of speculation about his future how has Miguel almeron been recently with all of this going on top top class I mean he as you know his his sort of playing Persona is his personality he's happy um a brilliant professional actually migy migy is one that will come in almost every day he lives his life through the through the football club his training performances this year is focus his his personality has been just very consistent with his normal self so I have no issues uh with him on that side you didn't have Fabian Sher the other night against wolves because of illness will he be back in the squad on Saturday we make a decision today Fabby trained yesterday but was uh not 100% um himself in terms of his well-being um nasty cough I think he had a nasty illness so we'll see how he's recovered today and then make a decision whether he's fit enough to be involved if you win this weekend it will set a new club record 10 wins in a row in all competitions it feels like a significant statistic but what's your attitude towards records and stats like that does it matter too much to you uh we've actually been quite relaxed during this run we've not focused on it we've not talked about it internally we've just gone on to the next game certainly not going to change now it will just be um about Bournemouth and making sure that we perform in the right way um I'm relaxed on these things because it's I know it's something for everyone to talk about of course we want to win and we want to keep the Run going as long as we can um but it's always about how we play and and that's what I'll be focusing on how do you see the picture at top of the Premier League table at the moment because you moved above Chelsea and into fourth the other night you can go third if you win because Forest play on Sunday um it is really tight and there are a number of teams just behind you as well who've who had good results in midweek yeah I think we've been saying all season it's a really unusual Premier League season in terms of The League table very tight congested I think every team going right the way down the league we'll look at if we can get some consistent results together we could be in the mix I think it works both ways so now we have to guard against falling off from where we've been so we've really enjoyed the Run we put ourselves in a really good position and now it's about foot to the floor and try and make more and just a couple of questions on Bournemouth who are one of those teams that are not far behind you um they almost got a a terrific victory at Chelsea the other night uh they're in brilliant form and doing um doing well without attacking players who are injured as well what do you like about the way they play yeah I like a lot about how they play I think they are never at a game I think you look at them um consistently and they've had some U remarkable turnarounds in games where they've been losing a game I think back to Everton um several other games where um they've had a real late um period of momentum in the game it switch the same and they end up winning the game so I think their spirit is undeniable in their performances you can see that togetherness that they play with I think andon deserves huge credit for not just the job he's done but the style of play that they they've implemented there and very difficult to play against very fastpaced aggressive I think it'll be a really good game tomorrow against two teams that sort of mirroring uh Styles although slightly different than how it's um constructed it will be two teams trying to win that's for sure and they're opening a new training ground soon I don't know if that was in the works when you were there but how pleased are you to see the the continued growth of Bournemouth off the pitch as well yeah that was very much in the pipelines I think Jason and I spent period of time designing it and trying to get it how how we would want it back then but of course well now A lot's changed um delighted really that the infrastructure of the club is now falling in line with the um the performance on the pitch that was always the big jump when you go from League 2 to the Premier League can your facilities and everything behind the scenes fall in line with the team and uh credit to the owners who have gone in there and done a brilliant job in investing um it's a it's a brilliant setup I've not seen it personally myself but uh delighted for Bournemouth thanks R Eddie other than uh other than Fabby that you mentioned a moment ago you're unsure whether you'll be involved or not is there anyone else that could miss or is it the same the same Squad as as the other night I think it'll be pretty much the same Squad yeah how pleasing is it right now that you're managing to keep your gu you're getting the odd injury Kum Wilson out for a couple of months nickp but it feels like you're controlling the injury situation a lot better than than L sorry well it's just you don't want to Temp Pate do you I think um but that that's helped your that certainly you would suggest helped your your Runner form that the core of the the team has been available to you over the last couple of months yeah without a doubt and I think that is a challenge ongoing um I think the schedule of games is different to last year the games we had last year especially around December hit us hit us hard um but I think you're right I think we've managed certain situations much better this year everyone deserves congratulations with that medical team sports science team uh James bun has come in and and had a really positive impact I think so I'm delighted with how that's working but it the challenge of that never stops now we we have picked up injuries to um important players but then other players have stepped up and minimized that absence and and that's always what you're looking to do you're looking for the squad to take the load we now miss Harvey who's a a big player for us missing Callum for the length of time we had been a huge blow missing Nick and his importance has been difficult for us but that's where credit to the players that have been fit because they've taken on the the burden and done really well do you have to be mindful of of Sven ahead of Tomorrow given that he played 90 the other night what less than 72 hours ago off the back of his engine yeah of course we we monitor all the players it's a quick turnaround in games it's an early kickoff as well so we lose a couple of hours there so we'll we're trying to make the right decisions for the team and for the squad and for the individuals um on Almer on and obviously you can't say too much with regards to what's going to happen with him potentially leaving if he were to go between now and the end of the window how how dangerous or would it be to to not replace him given that you're ligh in that position with with Harvey's in iny as well I know he plays on the left but your light on on Wingers should I say yeah I think it's not ideal but I don't think it's ideal from anyone's Viewpoint um from our side we don't want to lose players but we know that there's a reality to PSR and the ongoing managing of that situation so sometimes as we've said many times over the last few weeks we're making decisions not based on football but based on decisions that we potentially have to make for the future and I know you said after the Wheels game the other that you you hadn't heard anything at that stage regarding a move from fener bachche for for Lloyd Kelly is there anything that you've you've learned since then you can tell us nothing to Kei no okay for and for his situation though um could you understand if he was I don't know if he's frustrated or not but could you understand why if he felt it was difficult for him to play when he's obviously got Dan burn in there one of your top performance this season got Sven coming back in now there's a lot of competition in that position both at left Center back and I suppose at left back as well because Dan could potentially push over yeah Lloyd's not um talk to me at all about wanting to to leave the football club I think he's only just joined you know that I think that there's an understanding from his perspective that he's got to come in and earn the right to play and prove that he deserves to play ahead of other players so he's been absolutely no issue he's been great to work with as I knew he would be um he's waiting for his opportunities there's no issue with Lloyd at all um I think this is whatever rumors you're hearing a club driven um from from ferche not not from the player so um I want to make that very clear and Lloyd's an important part of what we're doing as I said he's recently joined we're working with him we're enjoying working with him and he's got an important part to play last one for me on on your Striker um he's absolutely on fire at the moment scored in an eight success of Premier League games how does it feel as the the manager knowing that you're going to the pitch with someone like that in your team and just as you walked in the room there I noticed that um it been announced that erling howand signed a new n and a half year deal at Manchester City would you like to would you like to hold down your own Scandinavian Striker to a n and a half year deal that's a long one um those two questions congratulations to him on that I think uh every Situation's different and I think from our Viewpoint yeah we could not regard Alex highly enough his contribution this season has been immense especially recently I think I don't want to change that Rhythm that he's in and I think it's about very similar for the team and for Alex not thinking too deeply just going into the games in a good frame of mind and enjoying your football and and try and carry on the form that he's in everything else off the pitch will naturally fall into place off of what he does on it so uh I'm sure there's you know lots of positive things in the future for him at the moment I just want him to concentrate on scoring thank you thanks Keith Andy Eddie did you manage at least a little bit more sleep last night than you did on Wednesday no not really actually it was a yeah it was a not enough sleep last night cuz I got to come in and meet you guys early um but uh no it was okay I'll move on to football the word calm has cropped up a lot recently player interviews I remember you talking ad Jason just after the Arsenal fulltime whistling saying calm is that the key how do you keep a side that have won nine consecutive games calm in an emotional landscape like Newcastle yeah I don't think it's been difficult to be honest I think the players have been very mature in their response to this winning run I I don't feel I've had to do too much to keep the focus to remain level which is a huge compliment to them because I think the players are seeing this as um an expectation that they have rather than their surpassing expectations um and I don't mean that in a in an arrogant way it's just I think there's a belief within the squad that you know we have good players and we can win games I think remaining level and just remaining focused on the next Target is always my preference The Lads can Rel you know obviously uh sometimes unwind mentally when there's a break in games but I think when you have the schedule that we've had recently you have to be absolutely Ely on the next one and then everything you need to do to recover to be ready for it and Bournemouth game as we said is a short turnaround we have to be ready mentally and physically uh and I hope we will be Keith mention the top four there asked s botman about it postmatch on Wednesday and said you know how desperate are the players to make champions league and he just replied desperate are you desperate for new cast Make Champions League I'm desperate for everything um but you are because you have to take and grab any opportunity you get so whatever the next Target is whatever is Achi able I'm desperate the players are desperate we want success we want tangible rewards for all the efforts that we're going to give um and we want to we don't want to wait we want to grab now so um that's definitely the attitude that I want the players to play with just a final one for me we've talked injuries already obviously Newcastle suffering them last year Bournemouth going through this mini injury crisis as well how well do you think they've done despite that in the last couple of weeks because you know it you've been through it here at Newcastle yeah they've done very well I think um when you have the number of injuries that uh we had last year and they've had this year it is very difficult to um to manage the load then becomes bigger on the individuals that are playing and you're at that Breaking Point sometimes where you you feel you can go over the edge if you get one or two more I think they've still got a very very good starting 11 um and still a good balanced team so Lewis cook played right back against Chelsea but did a brilliant job there so yes you know maybe slightly disjointed obviously the two Strikers losing them is a huge blow because they're the um the focal point of the team but I think andon and his coaching staff have managed that really well thanks thanks and morning Edie after um The Wolves game you um spoke about tanali and what he did defensively that people might not realize that the ground he cover that was picked up on Match of the day um at the game Joe Linton you know was celebrating making a tackle you've got these players quite literally running the miles from you H how do you get more out of them to continue this run well I think it has to come from the players themselves um firstly we just try and set the framework in the environment for them to enjoy and you hope that they feel the relationships with their their teammates on the pitch and that inspires them even more I think the Midfield especially the the work they're doing defensively has been outstanding in recent weeks it's played a big part in our in our in our wins I think the fitness levels of the players is very very strong I think we've recovered from a bit of a shaky start to the season in that respect where we didn't look ourselves um now I think we're seeing the importance of that that Fitness element in our game the ability to go right to the end of the game um to cover big distances but I think it's all about the individual player um within the team framework um and having the motivation levels to do that consistently you mentioned the fitness levels at the start of the season and not being quite right and could you have anticipated this this run that you've gone on what do you think is was it a number of factors coming together was it was it that Midfield three just all of a sudden you know a spark lighting what what has been the change or has it been multiple things yeah for me it's been multiple things I know everyone will want to think there's a one thing that that contributes to it and then you just if you keep doing that you'll keep winning games it's it's not not quite as simple as that I think whenever A team's successful or not successful there's multiple factors so we have to keep staying on top of the small margins the um the things that really affect our performance in a positive way we have to stay on top of them and make sure that we continue to do it while still evolving and there's still things from the Wolves game that we weren't happy with that we know we can do better with um and the challenge is to keep um keep evolving and just finally Newcastle have a very good record with 1230 kickoffs I think and beaten in the last six how do you feel about 12:30 kickoff well I feel all right I'm not playing um I wake up okay I think it is slightly different I think sometimes the kickoff can be there in in front of you before you know it um so I think your preparation your wake up time all all the things that maybe people don't see when the players eat how they eat is really really important of those early matches so hopefully we'll be ready thank you we'll fit as many as we can we'll start with Damian go Le Ian and Dom Eddie um anytime here you've you've made some big money signings think of people like Bruno Sven Alex um Tali people like that that have paid off really handsomely but how slim is the margin for error in a PSR world yeah well it's very slim because if you look at those signings and we didn't get them right we're left in a in a really awkward position because the the impact of PSR is so big that if if the the tradeoff in terms of trying to maybe move players on that you're not happy with and then replacing them that that becomes very messy now I know every team will say the same but failure in the transfer market was always a very costly thing but I think in this world it's it's even more costly so that's where the importance of future signings comes into place those those historical signings I think have been absolutely outstanding for us and I've said before I wouldn't change any of them um they've been magnificent but we yeah the importance of future recruitment takes on even a bigger focus in the future when when you brought Sandro in at the time did you think he was the final piece of the jigsaw then or somebody to build a future team around yeah I don't think anyone's the final piece of the jigsaw I think with Sandro um of course we were signing going into our Champions League season where we knew that the higher number of games we knew the importance of um the power of the squad going into that season unfortunately we lost him but for me he's multi-talented and the the sort of the profile we're looking for is someone that could play multi rolls in Midfield not not just one um yeah and he's everything that I hoped he would be um and more really I think he's really improving all the time um you know the training he did in between with with the ban um I hoped would pay dividends for him long term but without that match stimulus I think it was always difficult to see how much he had evolved and changed during during that time but I think now we're seeing that there's real growth in his uh performances thanks D couple from Le with um miggy's situation is it a risk to play him because if he did get injured tomorrow you'd lose the players Services potentially for a while and potentially lose the deal so is is that is that a risk everything's a risk Lee I I don't think we can look at it that I've got a player in the squad at the moment that is fit um available wants to play I have to use him to the best benefit of Newcastle United until the day he's not here and just with the sort of The Scouting situation obviously Scouts are being spotted around grounds you know you might not be able to spend any money do you have to kind of motivate The Scouting work a little bit as well as you play I've got enough people to motivate without motivating them that would be a strange one given a team talk to a group of Scouts um no I think uh your scouting process never changes even if you're active in the market or not you have to be out watching players you have to be building your knowledge and you have to have an eye on the unexpected could happen and suddenly we're we're able to recruit so we can't rest for one second um and those people involved don't need don't need motivating they know there's a lot of pressure on their shoulders to identify the next players we need thanks Lee Ian good morning Eddie morning H you you remind you there great believer in having settled teams particularly settled defenses now you got three Center halves who and questy all three deserve to start on on the on the form if they all stay fit this season would you consider rotating or could one of them the odd one out could he risk being out of the side for the rest of the season hypotheticals are very dangerous for me I think um yeah I do believe in a a settled back for ideally but there there's there's loads of different ways that you can be successful with and rotation is something that of course we look at depending on the game and different profiles to suit different games but I think that's what we've needed and what we've been crying out for for a long time is is more of a a squad depth so how you can't moan then when you have the squad depth and I think the challenge for the players is greater than ever within our Squad currently is you've got to perform well if you want to keep your place and I think that's a really healthy thing for everyone to have in the back of their mind so yeah potentially in the future I'll have some difficult decisions to make um but all for the benefit of the team look at Bourn mouth you've obviously still got a soft spot for them uh do you consider them Rivals for European place and would you like to see them in Europe next season they're absolutely a rival for a European place if you look at their um statistical data they're they're up in the position that they are on Merit and if anything could have ended up with a lot more points from some of their performances so they're absolutely there where they deserve to be um this isn't um something that we didn't expect really from playing them early season because I thought they gave us a very very good game at the Vitality Stadium they're very strong so terms of whether I'd like to see them there it depends where we are so um you know Newcastle the priority thanks Don morning Eddie in the summer there was a substantial amount of money to spend on a player that ultimately wasn't spent so I know you've touched on this previously naturally now in January people will wonder where that money is and why it may not necessarily be spent this month yeah I mean I'm not going to sit here and explain PSR because I don't even understand all of it um but it's it's not as clear as everyone make out there's not a pot of money there waiting to be be spent it's all about um the 30th of June and making sure you comply by that date so obviously if you spend money then you have to recoup it at a later date so hopefully that doesn't explain anything does it but uh in my head it does and on a different subject Nick Pope it's been six six weeks since his injury would you expect to have him back involved tomorrow um I think tomorrow might be a little bit too early but certainly he's going to be close for next week um he's not trained with us yet but he's certainly building up to that moment we're happy with where he is at um and he's yeah I think mentally he's he's getting there ready to play thanks we've got a Scott Luke and then Craig hi Eddie um how much how much how much have you at to as a as a head coach who's kind of you know seen football how it used to be if you like and and seen the changes how much have you had to get used to the fact that some recruitment decisions taken out of your hands so for example in Years Gone by if a manager didn't want to lose a player they wouldn't lose them now it's just not as simple as that yeah I don't I don't view that as a recruitment decision I I just see that as a a squad it's different recruit recruiting for me is you're bringing players in losing players from your squad is always um always a difficult thing yeah and this is slightly different I've never sort of had this this first experience of course was Elliott in the summer really that the big transfer um blow where you're losing someone that you don't have to lose footballing wise but you have to financially as we spoke about before um and I think this will happen again um yeah I think if you can't control it and you know that it's for the benefit of the club you you have to not be supportive of it but you can't block things you you can't be too clever because it's about the long-term future financial future of the football club so you've got to make smart decisions sometimes decisions that you no will impact the team maybe short term um but you have to take that pain thank you thank you be the first to say how informative and entertaining this morning's press conference that's very kind of you to say so um this is quite a long-winded question um so bear with me um I know you were you instinctively seemed a bit uncomfortable with the Keegan and Robson comparisons last well whenever it was we I spoke to you Tuesday but I think you've now got the highest win percentage of any Newcastle manager in the premier League how does that make you feel is that a sign of how well things have gone in the last three and a half years yeah well I think it's a a great thing I'd never view that negatively it's a it's a positive stat but I I don't know I think you can look at Stats all all types of ways to create whatever narrative you want I think for me the only uncomfortable thing is you don't compare yourself to anybody you don't intentionally think about it so those people have been l legs of the football club in the past um I hold them personally in the highest esteem for what they not not just for the jobs they did but for how they conducted themselves in the roles that they were in and they're they're legendary figures and rightly so but I don't view myself that way I view myself as just as a person trying to do the job to the best of my ability um trying to trying to win games for the football club I don't know if you you saw Lon orience um magnificent penalty shootout win over derby um in the week but there was a quote from the manager there that he's not typical Lon Orient anymore that they they're not set up to you know there a perception that the team lets them down that it disappoints at the last moment are you changing that mentality at Newcastle are you determined to not make it typical Newcastle United anymore well without a doubt we're we're trying to I wouldn't say change the narrative but we're just trying to build um a new mental framework that we can win anywhere we can achieve great things and not associate ourselves with any historical um negative psychological Viewpoint I think it's all about the future and trying to create new narratives for ourselves um we're very proud of the teams in the past that have played in the way that they have and built the legacies that they have and we Embrace that totally but we have to be our own team and we have to to try and create new history for ourselves than L Craig then Gary and Martin morning you've uh you've said before and you've said again to day that you're not making decisions based on football but decisions for the future of the football club is a head coach would you not go back and say if you make a decision for today it actually takes care of tomorrow with specific regards to replacing players and strength than the squad in this window if one does go you know if you look after now that might be the difference between champions league and not yeah I get your point and and your Point's a valid one but I think when you're armed with sort of the whole picture it it can look very different um so I think we have to make together and and this is the key thing we'll make decisions together won't be one person going and dictating to me that's what we're going to do there might come a time when that might have to be the case obviously if I disagree strongly enough on something but I've got to then give a a logical response as to what the solution is if if I say that so we' got to work together and make the right decisions for the here and now and of course for the future and we're try to do that together and that's the best way to do it with teamwork and consultation um but I I'll make this clear no one wants to lose any players from our current Squad um especially in positions when we're a little bit fragile and why would we want to leave ourselves in that position so no one wants to do it but then of course when you're armed with the facts and you have to make a decision sometimes you have to take that as I said that short-term pain and would these decisions this short-term pain would that I know you've hinted at this before but would that leave you in a very healthy position position potentially for the summer because as we've seen now the past three Windows haven't been what we've necessarily expected of a Saudi owned football club who in the Champions League last year could this summer be different I don't know if this summer will be different I don't know if suddenly the Outlook totally changes I think that's for another day um what I would say is hopefully the future Beyond whether I'm here to enjoy that future is of course as a football manager is um it's difficult to say but I think the future beyond that certainly looks very different great Gary hi Eddie um I'm sure you've seen or heard about Alan shir's comments about Newcastle now being in a a title race should players and fans dare to dream that they could catch Liverpool I don't know what you're talking about from from Allen now I have a few people have told me what he said I think um I always say and I've said this I think after the game against wolves um got no problems with supporters getting caught up in in any kind of feeling um emotion talk that that that's absolutely encouraged the players I think slightly different I think they've got to um still be controlled um sometimes that talk and those thoughts you can take your focus on what you actually have to do to get there certainly from my viewpoint would be more towards the player side um but I think it's important that we um we recognize our strengths and how strong we are and I think we are a really strong team when we're playing well um I really love our Squad I think our Squad is in a really good place I think we've got some very good players and we're trying to enjoy what we're doing without thinking too much about the consequences at this minute in time and just on uh isach obviously he's getting a lot of attention now close in on Jamie vard's potential record um how much s firstly do you think he is capable of of doing that and how can he improve still I think he's capable of that yeah without a doubt I think I'd just urge Alex very similar to what I just said in my previous answer not to think too much just keep enjoying his football um keep working hard and hopefully that run will continue I think he can improve in lots of areas and I'd say the same to any player you we're always trying to identify and then they're not huge radical big things because he's an elite player but there little tweaks that we can help him with uh either individually or the team can help him with um to try and get him more opportunities to score time FR Martin you got one to finish um when you left the jtech Community Stadium did you turn to Jason and say don't worry we'll win the next nine games yeah that was a that was a tough Journey back as I said before I think the uh we got the coach back the weather was really really bad very windy and me and Graham Jones watched the whole game back there and then on the bus and it was it was painful because you're watching back frustrated at what we were what we were delivering but posit I always think those times are positive because you're looking for things you're searching for for answers and yeah of course from that game we've made a couple of tweaks that's not why we've gone on the Run we've gone on we've gone on the run because we've got some very good players um but I think those times are good to look back on sometimes and and just remind yourself of what can happen in the game how painful it can be and try and stay away from those feelings for as long as possible just last want to finish how different is the mood inside a football club on a run like this and does that bit of History motivate you and the players try to sort of stay away from the history side and just as I said earlier concentrate on the game I have to say and and this might surprise people but I think the atmosphere is it's been pretty similar all season and that's a big compliment to the players whatever moment we've been in the players turn up very professional very um they just good people so I I I I'm not saying that it's a dramatically different feeling of course it's better because you're winning and there's more engagement and more energy more positive energy but not drastically different
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,l4s3ccVo82A,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4s3ccVo82A,Eddie um another good win at the weekend uh how are the The Lads feeling ahead of this one given the fact that the the Run extends to eight winning games now yeah Lads are good as you naturally expect um I think there's a a good energy good feel um we know this is an important week for us we're coming up to two big Premier League games um home games again so it's great great to be back at home and yeah we're looking forward to it you you left out a few of the players on on Sunday whove played a lot recently a couple of them out of the squad all together um how how are those players are they likely to be back involved for the wvs match yeah we'll have a look at them again today um they they were left out with genuine reasons um so all different things but nothing major we hope so minor problems that we needed to settle down uh fingers crossed they'll uh be there or thereabouts big week it was for fvan Bartman last playing the the two matches in the space of a few days will the rest since then have done him a decent amount of good yeah I think so I mean there's always a balance because you you of course after two such big physical games to F we needed to rest and recover him and there was a few warning signs that he was going into fatigue but then of course you need to get back up and running again because the the schedule is unrelenting so um yeah as I say those players will assess we're try and make the right calls for them individually and and hopefully they'll be okay and um Alex is obviously scoring for fun at the moment um I think he could set a new a new club record if he scores in this match it would be um eight Premier League matches in a row that he scored in eclipsing your own Joe willick and Club Legend um Alan sheerer I guess he'll be desperate to play and how good is it to have him part of your squad right now with the confidence I would guess coing through his veins yeah it'd be desperate to play of course um those those runs I'm I'm not really too focused on and and not too um interested in but I understand the individuals will um care deeply about them um I I'd love Alex to to continue to score I think um most important thing for me is that the team is functioning well for him and he's functioning well for the team the two thing go hand in hand together we have looked like scoring goals recently that that's such a big thing for our confidence levels he's played a big part in that hopefully that continues I don't know if you'd be more bothered about this record but um the last time Newcastle won eight in a row in in all competitions was 20 years ago when gram sunis was was in charge and the last time you won nine in a row nine in a row in all competition so was just over 30 years ago when Kevin Keegan was was in charge I know you'll only be looking to the next game but you've got two home games next week you could potentially Eclipse both of those do those records or potentially breaking those records mean anything to you I think they're nice um but I don't think we can look two games ahead we this next game is going to be hard enough we just look one step and it's for me it's always one step ahead it's the next game it's making sure that we approach the game in the right way I think there's there's dangers to winning games um there's warning signs that you know you need to stay clear of um we need to be absolutely focused and treat this game like an individual game that it is uh and then we'll move on to the next one when that happens but our our focus and preparation and our detail has to be spot on uh wolves will be a tough opponent for us is is there any is there any tiredness within the squad given the the schedule that you've had recently or of the number of wins that you've had and the way you've been playing does that kind of push that to the sidelines that the players maybe not think of that so much we've tried to manage that I think the the the three away games we had that that's a dangerous period because I think there's mental fatigue that can build in that period where you're always traveling and that sense that you're never um in one place for any fixed time so I think we we've tried to keep the lads from FR we've given them a couple of days off especially after the Arsenal game to try and keep them fresh so when they come in they're looking forward to coming in they're looking forward to training winning as you said naturally helps that feeling anyway so I'd like to think that fatigue won't be an issue and we spoke after the um Bromley match about Martin Deka you're probably fed up being asked about it but I think you said you were hopeful that you could come to some sort of agreement has there been any change in the last 48 hours no there's no change I think discussions will take place um when they are as I said I'm not directly involved in and just in terms of the the transfer window as a as a whole and I know you said you expected it to to be quiet halfway through are are you still expecting the same or could there be a a late flurry of activity well there's no change to that initial assessment currently but uh I will say with transfer Windows you can never you can never pre-plan them you can never think well that that's going to be our lot it can change in the blink of an eye so but at the moment we're on course for what we thought thanks Ed to us thank you Edie um obviously the home ties couldn't last long could they in the Cup competitions drawn away but Birmingham what's your reaction to that draw yeah I think uh always say we'd have preferred to be at home but um I think it's an interesting draw I think Birmingham in great form Chris Davis has done a brilliant job there um I think they've got big Ambitions as a football club so I think we know when that game comes around that'll be a tough test for us um tough ground to go to um but we look forward to the FA Cup um we're keen to do well in the competition my delivered driver said me yesterday morning he said this has potential to be an amazing season now do you and the lads start to think that considering what's happened over the last few weeks given the league form the cup form Etc I think it's healthy to think that up but I don't think you can um use that to sort of affect your thinking well I I can't I certainly can't I I'll let everyone else do that I think for me it's and I know it's boring but it is game by game and it is trying to keep our focus on what we can affect which is our next training session our next game and making sure that we're not getting ahead of ourselves in both ways so when we having the disappointing run it was about making sure that we didn't throw everything out and become despondent and etc etc but it's exactly the same when you're winning um it's making sure that you're consistent with what you do the messages are are clear um and we focus and don't take this position for granted really I think it's the Premier League is an unforgiving league and we can't take our off the ball we've seen it with so many players that you've worked with over the last few years we've seen it with Lewis Halon oliv mental Lewis Miley as well now willla producing the goods too how much pleasure how much delight do you get in seeing these players producing the goods after working so hard with them on the training ground I think um yeah I think that it's a the feeling you get from coaching and development is it's a sense of satisfaction I wouldn't say it's a a major high but it's a consistent thing in my life now I think and I think that's what first attracted me to coaching really that that Player Development that ability to affect people's lives and and improve their careers it's a really nice feeling um and I think we all share that here so me Jason Steph Graham Simon I think we all share that love for coaching and Player Development and I think as I say it's not a major high but it's something that's always there there in your life and that's what drives you every day to try and work closely with the players and build really good tight-knit relationships you go on the journey you see the highs and lows um and uh yeah for for me that's why we we love the job that we do Keith mentioned Martin Deka there there's been so much speculation over him in the last couple of how is he doing it himself because it must not be nice with all the speculation flying around about his immediate future I think Mar's handled himself really well in this period I think yeah there's been a lot of noise but I when I look at him he's exactly the same um I think he's got the experience now in his career to be able to handle these moments maybe as a a younger player um would have found it much more challenging but he's kept goal really well and I think he's been very measured in his approach he's NE never let anything off the field affect his psychology I think he's been top drw just finally just one on one wolves under veto Pereira obviously they you know they're experiencing an upturn in for what has he done right at wolves do you think why are they stronger now than they seemed to be before I think um he's obviously connected with the players very quickly you can see that I think they're playing with a confidence that belies their their form coming into when he took the job um they look a very subtle team they've got a really good way of playing a very brave way of playing a very clear identity their system has been uh formed when he came in and he's stuck with that and it looks like it's benefiting them so I think a lot of positives for how he's sort of attacked the role and wolves will be very dangerous opponents I think they've got some very good players especially in the front line um some dangerous attackers that we're going to have to control thanks thanks D um you mentioned wolves there being being tough opponents it this is the classic potential banana skin isn't it really after eight eight wins yeah I think it's a dangerous game for us because wolves are a a very good team and they've got good individuals as I say so we don't underestimate anyone in the Premier League we know how difficult the league is um and you have to be focused and mentally right to win any game so I think they're all the challenges that we Face we believe in ourselves we're at home we we love playing at home so there's a lot going for us as well but um firstly the the psychology of the team has to be right absolutely um you mentioned to bra what's the situation currently with uh Migel armaron there's no situation he's here every day he's fighting for his place in the team um yeah there's no change you're not expecting him to to go to America I've not heard anything um he's uh an important part of the squad okay um apparently uh a list of PSR breaches is going to be announced today um are you concerned at all about that that you might possibly be on that list no I don't I don't believe we are good that's excellent news um presumably that would take a weight off your mind you know going forward in this transfer window as well yeah of course the breaching of financial fair play for us was a something that we fought really hard in the summer to not um be in that position and that's why the uh departures the ones that we didn't want to to happen um had to happen um and yeah and hopefully we're not on that list oh fingers crossed um I keep forget I keep forgetting to turn this off in between sorry um just finally um when you're playing so many games in such a short space of time often the players prefer that to actually doing loads and loads of training and then playing because there's not that much training involved in between is is that the case at the moment yeah I think so I I think the the players enjoy training I think I'd like to think they do um um but I think there's no substitute for the games the games are what we all are here for that's what we train for so I think we're loving the games at the moment I think there's a really good atmosphere Home and Away the supporters are backing us we're playing well um so yeah bring him on so just finally I me you know you took isack off uh a couple of games ago is he is he fit to play on Wednesday he will be there or thereabouts we haven't seen him train yet but fingers crossed he will be thank you thanks still go to George Dominic and then Jordan morning Eddie um you you said just before that there are dangers to winning games and that there are warning signs you need to stay clear of what what are those dangers well I think naturally it's part of the human brain that um whatever segment of results you're in whatever you're feeling there can be dangers to both winning and losing and I think for us the warning signs will be a la lack of focus um and that that really appears first on the training ground and making sure the players are absolutely ready absorbing the information that we try to give them preparing for the game in the right way and not lowering of Standards um I have to say I haven't seen that that the players have been very professional um during this period you don't get the runner results we've had if you um don't have that right focus and preparation mentality um but it's really important we don't drop um we know how hard every game is in the Premier League um and this game will be no different and you've talked in the past about sort of having a fear of tomorrow and being motivated by fear is is that the fear when things on the face of it are going sort of so well that it's a it's a bit of complacency that drifts in is is that what it is at the moment yeah I think you got to guard against all of those things I think you just got to take I try to take every day I don't prejudge sort of the attitude of the players I'll I'll sort of see it face to face and react accordingly at the time but I I've got to say to this moment the the attitude and the desire and the motivation to win games has been really high and I think that's the biggest thing that can't fall um I think the players see the bigger picture I think we know how tight the league is still we know that everything is there for us to play for we can't lose sight of that and I think it's those that Ambitions got to be in the team all the time thank you Dominic morning Eddie Harvey Barnes went off injured at halime on Sunday is there any update on him yeah Harvey will be missing for a period of time um we don't think it's a serious injury but it will be enough to keep him out for a few weeks I think we're probably looking around a month don't hold me to that but that's sort of the early assessment he's had a scan um as I said it's not too bad but it's it will be enough to keep him out he definitely missed the upcoming games what is the injury specifically it's an injury to his thigh a muscle in his thigh he did it crossing a ball just towards the end of the first half um he felt he could carry on till halftime but then that became Apparent at Hal time that he couldn't come out for the second half thank you Jordan he how tough is decision do you face at right center back tomorrow with Sven bman and Fabian both available yeah got a couple of tough decisions to make in the team I think um we've got and that's the sign of a a good team and A Sign team that's winning games we players that have put their hand up to to start they've come in and done well they've elevated the team level and now with of course Fabian coming back from suspension that'll be a decision they have to make and we've seen footage of vak Salia on T side over over the weekend pitch with you um yourself and did you manage to talk to him and what what what did you manage to say at one yeah managed to have a good conversation with him his family and his Representatives um seemed like a really good lad really great attitude hungry to learn he his next step is slightly unclear but um certainly a talented young player and how big of a coup is that for the football club because it's talk with Newcastle beating off beating off a lot of competition to to sign him yeah I think with the young players I think that's where we have to be we have to be in the in the in the hunt for talented young players around the world the best young players if we can give them a pathway here and an opportunity to develop their skills whether that's the next steps on loan or whether that's coming in house um certainly um The Scouting team the recruitment team is doing a lot of work with the younger younger players and I certainly am uh wholeheartedly support that thanks John we've got to Lee Rebecca and then Craig Eddie on the PSR situation obviously between January and June 30th last year was pretty tough time for the club do you feel sort of more educated as a club now on those rules going forward especially with what's going to get announced later today um I think I think the club were educated last year I don't think there was any surprise I think I don't think that was an issue I think maybe going back a couple of years that that might have been different because I don't think the clubs were fully understanding what the the punishments would be what the consequences would be um but I think once they became apparent then I think that certainly got everyone thinking seriously about the uh the PSR situation and I think for us yes last year was very difficult um and that's of course then a knock on effect of what happened last summer PSR continues to affect our decision making and every moment you know whether that's a contract renewal whether that's what whatever the situation regarding our Squad we have to think long and hard about every decision we make now and that will continue to be the case as long as the rules um are as they are so certainly we're aware of everything and last year will serve as a good reminder do you sort of not dream but you do you look forward to the day when you've got kind of a blank canvas and you can't go out and see we can get two or three players in this window yeah I don't how I don't know you know how the rules are going to change or if they're going to evolve through time and I don't know how our club will um continue to adapt to the rules and our obviously our income's key and talk of new stadiums Etc and and all those things that will benefit us in our pursuit of bringing more income in are going to be really important to how we evolve as a football club but that's for another day uh I think my focus as always is on the next game just on on isach how how careful do you have to be with him knowing that Callum Wilson isn't there as a as a backup I know you've got other players who can slot him but how careful do you have to be with him yeah we have to be careful of course but um that's why I did what I did against Arsenal to try and protect him and make sure that we don't lose him he's such a valuable player for us but fingers crossed all being well he he'll be fine and he'll take his place in the team thanks thank you more Eddy obviously it's it's just over a month since that brenford defeat and then you've gone on this winning run are there any kind of particular changes that you can see from the team in that almost kind of patchy form before brenford into this winning run now um certainly we haven't done anything radically different um I think people naturally assume oh you know after the brenford game I RI the walls off and this that and the other and then players responded and I think sometimes nothing could be further from the truth because I think you have your your your beliefs and your princip and your style of play and then you're just always molding and tweaking and changing that to try and find a winning formula and I think the the biggest um people that deserve credit and a lot of Praise Is is the players for what they've done and how they've put that brenford defeat behind them how they responded to that moment and then the consistency that we've shown since and that's what we were craving All Season that that's that run of winning games that everyone is fighting for um we've managed to put together now that key thing is that we can't fall off that and we've got to try and continue to be as focused as we have been it's not just the winds as well it's like the goals being scored has obviously got all the plaudits but your defense has done really well as well I think it's only three goals conceded in that period just how impressed are you with them well certainly we needed to respond to that brenford game because that was the most disappointing thing to come out of that game I thought we scored two goals we look like we could score more but the four goals we ConEd were weren't us anywhere near our best so the yeah the the defensive resilience we've seen in especially in certain games away from home tough grounds we we've defended really well um and I do believe that if we can defend consistently well and that goes through the team that we can score goals so I think it's a good mix for us thank you Craig morning n today today's PSR announcement has brought that back into focus and we've spoken about this before but one of the sad quirks of it as we saw that and this is the academy players who are sold do generate that pure profit someone like Louis Miley potentially all of a sudden becomes your most salable asset what do you think about that are certain players off limits someone like Lou Miley you know obviously it goes without saying you wouldn't want to lose him but where are you on that with regards to those Academy products and PSR and someone like Louis in particular yeah I think without necessarily going into individual players I think the last thing we want to do or I want to do as the manager of the club is to sell Academy products that have the potential to play for this team for many many years Elliot being a case in point really that was the last sale we wanted to make we knew Elliot's qualities um it just broken into the team really at the back end of last season and performed really well in a variety of roles for us but we were faced with literally no other option in that moment with 48 hours to go we had to make a decision that we didn't want to make so I think it will always be our last choice to do that um but when you add everything together and you go well it's a points deduction breaching PSR or making a sale I think you have to make the sale on Louie as well what is he is he is he a six is he an eight is he a 10 he certainly look good in the six on Sunday can he in the short term be Sandro's body double you're back to the Midfield balance again he's a bit of everything um I wouldn't want to label him at the moment in terms of one position I think he played really well at a six and I loved him in that position on Sunday he got a lot of the ball and he took that responsibility excellently but he has the ability to play as an eight I think when he played last year majority of the time he was the higher position remember him scoring assisting certainly got great legs and I think what he's added in his timeout is bit more physicality a bit more power um his aerial abilities improving as well so very much an allrounder who can do a bit of everything thank you I good morning Eddie uh Keith mentioned earlier that you can equal a record set by Kevin Keegan side with Victory tomorrow uh you you are already mentioned in the same breath as Keegan and Robson how exciting is it for you personally that you're in a position to eclipse the achievements of those Club Legends yeah I mean for me they are Club Legends and and rightly so um I don't really want to sort of talk about them together because they're individually they're what they achieve for the club Kevin as a as a player and as a manager and soobi is the the sort of figure that he was um yeah I can never think about putting myself at their level um but we just want to achieve what we can achieve and try and take the club to to great places so it's not about trying to sort of measure ourselves against them it's about just trying to achieve for for the people here and our supporters it's quite interesting just what you said that you don't feel personally at their level do you I I just don't think about it I don't I think comparisons players managers are very difficult things to do because it's different eras it's different times but those people quite rightly for me are talked about and will continue to be talked about here for many many years thanks Luke don't take this the wrong way some people have said you're quite boring um does that help you are you going to give a bit more detail on that or well your obsession with work football everything to do with the job does that help you as much in the good times as it does in the bad times I've just insulted you for no just trying to get my head round the uh the critique of my personality um I think my uh I never sort of list my strengths or weaknesses to be honest but I think my ability one of my abilities or strongest abilities will be to try and stay level um now whether that's boring or not that's for maybe other people to decide who know me better than you do but I think um I think keeping that stability in in All Phases wins losses draws success perceive failure is important in this role because I don't think your players want to see you that there's a time to be emotional but not overly emotional continuously continuously and it is that that can be quite draining and then you never quite know what to expect I like to be there for my players on a an emotional level on a daily basis and I think extreme reactions will never help that thank you thanks Luke Martin hi Eddie I'll avoid the insult I'll leave that to Luke um C can this season be a great one yeah I think this season can be I mean we're we're fighting on all fronts really um I think it's down to us it's down to us we're coming to a key stage every game is potentially a pivotal moment and we want to we want sort of these next run of games to be pivotal moments for the good not for the bad so you saw brenford a really good reaction to a negative moment um then might come that time again where we have to respond really strongly to a difficult situation um so yeah we just have to keep trying to win games as many as we can and can you feel a mood change amongst the players now in terms of league position two cups everything start starting to boil uh and move in the right direction yeah I just sense with the players a good feeling um they're coming into work in a positive frame of mind there's a yeah I always think this season there's been a really good feeling between the players I sense a strong tight-knit group I wouldn't say that if I didn't feel it um and a really good response to a difficult start which is really pleasing it means we've got the mental qualities that we need thanks Mar go to Gary Kieran and then Don hi Eddie what is it actually being like in charge of the country's most informed team and what pressures does that bring it doesn't feel any different to be honest it you know I think we've just gone from game to game and we've we've performed well I've been very proud of the efforts from everybody the staff and the players and we've enjoyed it but uh I don't think we've looked too deep into it I don't think we've tried to overthink we just I've encouraged the players to be free to try and express themselves to their best level and yeah see where it takes us can you I know you've just touched on it briefly uh a moment ago but can you feel a change in their mentality of going from sort of the hunters to the hunted everyone wants to beat Newcastle now with the run there they're on does that change anything in the players mindset yeah I don't necessarily get that feeling that there's been a huge shift in that respect I mean the Premier League is so competitive anyway everyone wants to beat each other you go from every game knowing how determined the opposition are to to win they've got their own aims and Ambitions we've got ours I I don't sense a massive shift in that respect but we know going into two two home games and of course we're going to look at wolves first but how difficult that game is going to be and how difficult every Premier League game is if you um drop from your best levels that the challenge for us is to stay where we have been thanks Gary K morning uh we've previously seen a group of teams dominate the Premier League but obviously Newcastle and ASV have disrupted that in recent years and see borm and notam Forest up there does it feel like change is coming that anything can be possible even with the the barriers you face yeah I mean I think I've always I answered this question a lot I believe anything is possible for us I've I've said the same last season I said the same the season before there's never a ceiling on what you can achieve the only ceiling is what you potentially put in your own way and I think that's an important point I don't think we can try and put anything in our way we've got to focus on ourselves we've got to be continue to be the best us we've got I think a great Squad a tight-knit squad you know not not huge numbers any player we lose from injury is a big blow for us that's why the Harvey situation was a big blow on Sunday um but then opportunities for other players to step up and prove their worth and maybe there is a narrative before this season that Newcastle wouldn't be in the conversation even at this stage of the season has that been fuel for you at all um no because I don't necessarily expose myself to to those opinions I think they're that's that's a waste of my energy and resources so it's I I know there's opinions out there and I'm sure opinions are based really off our performances in our our games in early season quite rightly we received some criticism I'm sure but it was up to us to answer that and to try and fight back and the only way that we know and that's the that's the win game d hi Eddie is the recent success even more satisfying after the difficult summer I think success is always satisfying to a degree I mean but I think where I am now we're in the middle of a season and we've achieved nothing um so it's it's a good run that's all it is at the moment and we're sort of in the in the key moment where that could turn into something else so that's why I think I would urge the the players and myself included to ignore everything and just focus on the next one and try and win that game and would no movement in our route be a successful window um depends on your Viewpoint really I think because it's it's not just um a clear straight line for for me from a footballing perspective that would probably be the best outcome but of course it's not just a football perspective to think of
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,1-wecENkvHo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-wecENkvHo,good morning Eddie firstly how is Alexander ISAC uh yeah we think he's pretty good um he's um seeing his physio at the moment um giving him a couple of days rest so uh but no we think he's in a good place we'll he'll report back tomorrow and we'll have a good look at him so it doesn't appear to be a serious injury or a big concern certainly from the the initial assessments no not from the initial assessments fingers crossed he's going to be okay and would it have been the case anyway or is it fair to say that given the schedule that you've had and the FA Cup tight the weekend that he might have been um given a breather anyway on Sunday because of course you've got a lot of players who would want minutes and someone like isack has um got through a lot of work recently yeah it would have been the case but we would have probably um involved him in the game in some way but I think with what's happened he'll probably um be given this game to rest and get himself right for the future schedule that we have over the last couple of weeks you've answered a lot of questions about the situation uh with Martin duka who was quite emotional at the end of the match on Tuesday um what is the latest on that and has anything changed with his status as a Newcastle player over the last couple of days no nothing's changed I've got no updates to give you really it's business as usual as far as I'm concerned with Martin he's still here still very much part of what we're trying to do and he's playing very well so um no nothing to update you with do you think he wants to stay with you at least until the summer yeah I think Martin's been in a difficult situation like any player that is coming out of contract in the summer I think it's it's always with every player that I've ever worked with there's always that feeling of of Doubt um he will naturally sort of want some concl some conclusion to his future whether that's um um a new contract with us or whether you know what whatever the outcome but he certainly played very well and I've been really pleased with him I think he's um more than played his part in our recent run of fixtures um again against Arsenal I thought he was very very good so um hopefully we can come to some sort of agreement with him we've already touched on it but how much of an opportunity is this weekend to make some changes and get some uh action and some minutes for some players who are clearly in need of it while also balancing the need to pick a strong team and ensure that you get through yeah absolutely that is the balance that we um face this weekend because I think we knew going into the Arsenal game The Lads that had played the majority of the minutes were in a in a good place obviously mentally um but physically we were a little bit tired the Tottenham game was a huge physical game for us and then the Arsenal game on top of that was another in a really short time so we always had on the horizon this game when we knew that that we would have to rotate our Squad we've got players that very good players that are desperate to play and desperate to show their qualities so I think it's a good game for them to Showcase those qualities but also we have to get through and that is our Aim so we have to pick a strong enough Squad and this is going to be a difficult game because Bromley in very good form themselves in their league they've been on a really good run and Andy's done a great job you're already in the latter stages of one cup competition you want to run in the other domestic cup don't you obviously it will mean more matches in the final part of this season but you're more than halfway through the Premier League so the capacity and the SPAC is there isn't it to to have another cup run the desire is there from us from us all I think we don't prioritize any competition ahead of any other we want to try and win the next game in front of us so that that's how we've tried to focus on this season and this game will be no different the preparation will be exactly the same as always we'll go into depth um on our opponent we give them in the utmost respect and we try and win the match final thing you've talked in the past about when you were a young fan and watching an FA Cup Final and how that got you into the game um the competition in general how much do you still love it because there have been lots of changes to it over the years um there's no replays now obviously from from this point in the FA Cup so um it has been tinkered with but is it still a special thing for you still the FA Cup I I don't think it's changed at all in my mind um um the FA Cup was the competition as you said when I was growing up and it was one of the things that attracted me first to to football itself The Knockout competition the drama that it gave was the thing one of the things that hooked me very early in my life so that name the FA Cup it doesn't change there's still a magic to it um and we're on the other side going into this game where Bromley will have all that hope um and the magic of the cup and we need to make sure that we're really professional and try and get the job done thank you um sorry to take you back to it but in your first um couple of months in in charge I wonder when it was straight in um but it's it's a reminder isn't it that you know that those kind of things can happen in a in a cup competition and it's probably one of the games that you probably remember more than than anything I would imagine because you hate to lose yeah it was um I remember being really excited before the game to see Kieran play Kieran trippier I think that was his first game and really uh because I knew what a game changer he would be for the team and for the for the whole club so I was really excited to see him and I've had a really good feeling before the game we we needed to win I thought we were the players were really focused so it goes to show you know a game like that where we were desperate we would have done anything to win that game um that came which came here they're in good form themselves very similar to Bromley really in the respect that they were doing well in their league um and we we just couldn't score the goalkeeper had a great game that day I remember and the longer we didn't score the more you feared that they would get one chance they did and yeah but I I think Looking Back Now with different eyes I look back totally I see it totally differently it was probably a I don't want to say a good thing but for what we needed to do in that season and stay in the league it was distraction probably that in hindsight looking back it was probably a good thing we didn't have we were able just to focus on our league form and our league form turn round and we ended up having a a really good second half to the Premier League season about about the game um um Andy Woodman coming back who obviously spent a lot of time here as a goalkeeper coach have you have you come across him before in your in your career yeah well Lee was telling me that I scored against him a couple once once yeah I scored against him once which um I didn't remember um I'm sure Andy probably doesn't either to be honest um but that was a career highlight for me uh but now of course yeah I've come across Andy and managed um Freddy Woodman um here so a lot of respect for the family Freddy was a a great goalkeeper and a great character for me when I was in my early stages here handled himself brilliantly and I know Andy from speaking to a lot of staff was very very liked here he was a real bubbly character a great sense of humor um and a very good coach so I think he's done a brilliant job I have to say at Bromley he's done incredibly well to win the fa Trophy and to get promotion into League 2 full credit to him for the job that he's done and continuing to do because it's not easy to go into a new league and stabilize themselves like bromy have and I guess nice for you guys to have a a home tie because you'd gone a long time to get one and now you've had a few in a row and given the week that you've had and what has taken out of the players nice to have a HomeTown Sunday where you can rotate a little bit yeah absolutely I think the three games that we had away were were brilliant brilliant days for us brilliant games but tiring um so yeah it's good to be back at home and now we have a a little run at home where um we're always excited to play at St James's Park and and in these games that they're never easy home or away but I think um it's just nice not to be traveling again from our perspective just on the on the Martin Deka situation does it complicate things slightly for him that he's in he's in the team at the moment he's obviously playing very well and I know you're not going to want to get too far ahead of yourselves but he's 90 minutes away from playing in a cup final and for someone who's been at the club for what seven or eight years it's a big part of of his heart he would love to sort of potentially go down as a as a club Legend does that is that complicating the situation do you think for him a little bit as well um I'm sure from Martin's never said he wants to leave um and he's been a very very very good professional for us he's coming to the team I think a compliment to him because it's difficult for a goalkeeper when Nick was playing and Martin obviously wasn't and he's waiting for his chance and he have to stay ready you have to stay focused you never know when that Chance is coming it came and he was able to come straight into the team and perform and that's down to his his training levels have always been very very high he's a wholehearted whatever the weather he's he's there um yeah and I know how much Newcastle means to him and you can see that emotionally he's very invested and of course all those things will be playing a part into his decision- making into our decision making and hopefully there's a a successful outcome at the end just finally from me um Bruno gimash and and Fabian sh were obviously both suspended the other night could the the two of those come back into your your thinking for for Sunday to give them game time yeah they could do I've got to try and get the balance of the team right um it's not a simple uh Team to select so I've got to make sure we're competitive I've got to make sure we take a lot of boxes physically I've got to make sure that for example set plays and everything height-wise that we're we're well balanced um so yeah I'm try and uh look at all the the players individually and make the right calls thanks ke morning Edie you've spoken about um the great job Andy Woodman's done at Bromley and uh the good run that they've been on how is it preparing for I mean with the Premier League you see those teams week in week out you you know all the players what's it like preparing for low a lower league opposition for the FA Cup it's it's pretty similar to be honest of yeah you might not know so much about the the individual players but then you have to find out about the individual players very quickly so a lot of work goes in to make sure that we are as well prepared as we would be for a Premier League game um processes are exactly the same there's no substitute for me sitting down and watching the team and watching the team several times to get an idea of of what we need to do against them um so that will never change those players that might be given an opportunity on Sunday you said that they're desperate for minutes are you expect I mean are you expecting a lot of them on Sunday I always expect a lot of them I know that they're all very good players um the challenge for us is if you're going to make more than say three or four changes then they've got to gel together as as a team and that that's always the the big thing but the way that we train and the way that we prepare I don't see that being an issue uh then it's up to the players to perform in the way that we know they're capable of and I think it's an opportunity for whoever does play um that hasn't been getting regular minutes to to show their own qualities to show what they can add to the team that's already playing um I don't doubt um the level of their games but um you always firstly have to match the um the level that the opposition brings and we know that Bromley are going to bring a lot of heart and a lot of fighting spirit and to win the game we're going to have to match that and just finally for me you've spoken a lot about Martin de braa but when you have a team that is doing so well is there a sense of in this window you don't want anything to rock the boat on the pitch or off the pitch because there's a lot that players will bring behind the scenes as well yeah definitely I think I I think I said right at the start of the the talk on January that we didn't really want to focus on any outgoings um or anyone that we didn't want to leave or have to lose um due to other reasons it's not a month for me to destabilize anything it's to try and um keep the harmony of the group the the the the feeling in the group is really strong at the moment as you can imagine um for us it's about we're in the busy spell of fixtures trying to win as many games as we can can continue that form and um yeah see where we end up thanks guys will add a session for Sundays as well so please just bear that in mind with your questions and we'll start with Damian hiie hi just looking back at the last three games have you had a better three- game Run of results in your career and does that represent a significant Bridge cross that you've gone to places that you don't traditionally do well and you've got good results um I haven't gone back through the archives to be honest Damian you you don't tend to um I don't imagine I have [Music] um I think yeah I don't know about bridges crossed I think certainly psychologically I think the the big step forward the last three games to do what we did in those three games I think um just speaks volumes for the the mental capacity that we possess the a lot of doubts and a lot of question marks from me to the group about our consistency levels our ability to put a winning run together early season uh so that's why it's hugely satisfying to see the the group be motivated um consistent with our performance driven I didn't see any weakness in terms of our psychology in those three games and that's a that's a big step forward I think so the challenge always is to continue that and not go away from what we've shown in the last few games um delighted with the response from the players um after the game the other night Anthony Gordon said Dan burn has been your player of the season so far does that sort of emphasize that it's not necessarily the price tag that's important it's it's the right player for the right situation yeah I didn't know anony had said that and I'm I'm pleased he did because he's not mentioning himself in that so he's he's passing the price somewhere else which I always think is a good thing um and quite rightly to Dan because I think Dan has been very very good this season he has been and he always shows for me the the the spirit that we need he knows what it means to represent the football club he conducts himself in a a brilliant way whether it's on the pitch or off the pitch um but he has been the model of consistency and he has been someone that you can rely on and you need players like that um yeah when we signed down he maybe wasn't the um the sexiest name we could have brought to the football club but for me he's been fundamentally vital to what we've done because he cares so much he lives his life the right way and he's a very regular player thanks D Gary at the back morning Eddie um I just wondered if you been a victim of it before if you could describe what is it like can you point the words being a victim of like a a giant killing or an upset in the FA Cup yeah well the boot was usually on the other foot in my early career we were the team going against bigger clubs and looking for that for that opportunity really to put our name in FA Cup folklore that that was a big driver for me as a player I was desperate to do he never really got the tie that gave me that opportunity as a player to experience that um but as a manager was chasing that that same dream really early in my career and now trying to make sure we're not on the uh on the other end of it is a is a totally different feeling but I think you you take away all those emotions really and then you end up just preparing the game and seeing the game as it is it's a one-off game we need to do certain things right um to make sure we're in the next round and a lot of those are mental qualities um psychological um issues that we have to combat cuz then with our quality you'd hope we'd have enough but these games always fall down to that um we can't uh fall victim of not wanting to win the game enough we can't be loose in our preparation and we'll make sure that we're not thanks Gary Lee ryer then Chris WF more Eddie um onto Brava uh even if he plays another couple of games and then doesn't play a game this season to keep him would that still be the right decision if there is a cash offer on offer um yeah I mean I think the the right decision will be the right decision and that's not just for us but it's for for Martin as well um as I said the other day there's always lots of different sides to a a situation it's never as clear as the outside people may think um Martin is performing really well um he's been a model professional we want to keep him um he's never said that he wants to leave so hopefully we can find the right conclusion and with isach um obviously you paid a lot of money for him I don't know what the exact fee was but do you look at him now and think that was one of the best investments you've made as a manager yeah I think it would be up there I mean I think the transfer fee is always a difficult one because if you actually look at the fee alone for me again especially with my background I'd look at it and think dear I'm not sure I not sure you can commit to that because it's it's such a lot of money but then when you look at the quality of the player and and you look at what he can do and what he can bring and I I had I wouldn't say no doubts because you always have doubts with with any signing especially when the players not in the league um as you as you sign him there's always going to be some question marks that the Alex would have to answer but I had very few doubts about the quality of the player I thought he was outstanding I'd watched him a lot and um loved everything about him and it was a lovely feeling when he comes through the door and you're still in love with him after a few days of working with him and uh obviously just looking at the run seven games seven wins um after that what the Lord brenford what what's easier in football to to get to that top level or to stay at that top level cuz that's what you've got that's your challenge Now isn't it to to keep this going that is the challenge and that's why I said for me that the biggest compliment I can play the players is how they've conducted themselves during the last three three games there was no drop off on Focus there was no drop off on energy levels we kept going right to the end I think we've been fortunate now that we've had a a tiny little break in a very busy schedule to try and refresh the players to try and make sure that they've got energy again and they're they're not overloaded with information and games and sometimes that can leader tail off in performance um but now we can't lose focus again we have to get it back very quickly we have a big spell of games coming up and we don't want anything to derail that thanks Le we'll go to Chris Jordan and then Aaron Chris morning Eddie on Martin Deka you said to reach an agreement or the right conclusion has he been offered another contract I'm not totally um up to date with everything Chris so I I don't want to tell you any lies um but talks are definitely ongoing and you you mentioned about outgo that you don't necessarily want to lose anyone have you had any bids for any of your players beyond the the Martin situation that's on going I don't think so but again I don't want to tell you any lies I I don't think so mon could we get an update on Callum Wilson please a month since the the last one that you gave yeah Callum his I think he's on the grass today I don't think he's training with with the first team yet but he's on the grass um he's making good progress actually we've been very pleased difficult again such a difficult situation for him um he didn't feel quite right after the the end of the game against brenford as we know went for a scan scan unfortunately picked up a sort of a bigger problem than he felt he didn't feel it was a big issue um but it meant for weeks on the sideline for him but he's he's in a good place he's normal Callum very very focused on his return um and he could be coming back if he all goes to plan round about February we think beginning of February he could be coming back at a massive time for us um with some huge games so he's very focused on this comeback I think with with K I think Nat will ass as a strike I would expect to see more of him maybe um how is he developing behind the scenes and could we see him start tomorrow yeah we could I mean as I say all options are available to me I've got to make the right decision um will is continuing to develop I think it's been difficult the last few games because I've had to make decisions in in running what to do in a couple of situations so against Tottenham we were winning and I decided to put a a midfielder in Alex's position when Alex was fatigued and had to come off that's cuz we're protecting the lead and I wanted someone with real experience who could manage the game for us and it was very similar the other night against Arsenal where um um we're in a different phase of the game and I felt I needed real experience to help us navigate those last few minutes on the pitch but will is on the other side developing really well and if we were needing a goal the decision would have been very different so I have to say in training he's we've had a few 11v 11 games he's looked really sharp he scored goals um if he is involved this weekend I'd expect him to play well thank you we go to Aaron then Dominic and cck morning Eddie um how is Sven botman after the other night physically sven's doing well yeah I think there was naturally just a buildup of fatigue I mean it was a big ask for him to play the two games that he did um with consultation with Sven and the medical team he felt he was able to go again against Arsenal a very quick turnaround two high level games um and how well did he do I mean I thought he was absolutely brilliant in both games and when you consider he was feeling a bit fatigued in is groin I think in the second half you wouldn't have known in his performance he was determined physical excellent in in near enough every respect and especially when again you consider he's on an unnatural side of the pitch you wouldn't have known and that gives us Real Food For Thought for the future that he could play that role um so fingers crossed um yeah no will effects and just on sorry one more time yeah uh just on black ad OS obviously Deka has been in the headlines he's been in the team but we haven't really seen much of adicus how has he been behind the scenes and what is he offering your team at the moment he's been excellent behind the scenes he's a really um lovely lad really nice person he's got a a really nice way about him very Smiley happy um but you can see he's driven and he's a vastly experienced goalkeeper so I think he's added a lot to the training group he's been um actively involved in all training that we've done and he's become a you know uh really well-liked member of the team well-liked member of the goalkeeping uh team but also the the first team so he's been uh he's been excellent I think with his conduct around the building thanks yeah Craig and then Martin Craig he uh on Martin de brav you said he want the player to stay the situation you asking him to stay and be part of it's not as if you're asking to stay and be part of a relegation fight you know what you've got going on here at the moment is pretty special does that make your side of those talks and that you know the discussions you mentioned does that make that easier yeah I think it will of course I think the team's in a good moment Martin's in a good moment he will know that he's been an important part of that um so yeah I don't don't think there's been any part of this that's been negative I don't there's been no um I think the main focus really is on Martin's future I think I think that's the the pro the the area that we as a football club need to clear up with just six months left on his length of his contract and I think that will be the the important thing for Martin and if you can't persuade him will he dispatch burn and botman they seem like you're pretty persuasive P we do whatever it takes Craig Ed on a similar thing how how far away is Nick at the minute yeah he's not far away he's doing well um so he hasn't trained with the group yet but that's mainly because we haven't had a huge amount of training days because of the amount of games that we've played um he's done goalkeeping co uh training one-on-one with with the coaches he's done diving kicking he's done a lot but I I just think there's a bit longer needed before his knee's fully uh strong enough to play so um we're not looking too far away I think probably after this intense run of games
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,NYA-B1atBF0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYA-B1atBF0,good morning I just want to check on a couple of players from Saturday firstly Sven botman I know he spoke about him after the game but um that was a lot to get through after so long out um have you had chance to assess him since Saturday and how is he yeah he feels good um naturally a little bit of fatigue at the end of the game I think with Fen I think yes it was a long absence but he's trained for a long long time for this moment and from the Aston Villa game onwards he was cleared to play but we wanted to give him longer um to try and reach um his best physical levels um so it's not like he's been rushed back um but straight into action did very well um really pleased with him I think regardless of how you train and what you do premier league is different to anything else you can't really prepare for that intensity that comes but he handled it really well you've got a lot of midweek football this month including tomorrow in the semi-finals of the league cup with a player likees Sven botman do you have to phase him back or do you feel he's ready just to play regularly now if you choose that yeah I think it's a combination of things I think we have to speak to the player we have to speak to the medical team and the experts that will give me the um some of the answers to what we do with him next um but I think sven's a competitor he he is hugely driven for the team and for himself um wants to do really well in his career so I've got no doubts what he will say but we need to um as I say speak to other people and then try and come up with the right decision and how was Anthony Gordon doing after sustaining that quite nasty facial injury in the second half yeah Anthony was in a bit of discomfort I'd say only with the cut um which was a nasty looking one um looking back at the decision I thought it was I thought it was a foul I thought it was a clear penalty um and he came away from that incident um you know as I say with with blood um on himself so we we dusted him down he went back on the pitch and performed really well for us I thought he had a really good game um so we'll see how he is today once again you won't have Fabian Sher available because of suspension but also against Arsenal in this first leg there'll be no Bruno either because of a a one match ban in the League Cup how big a blow is it to lose your captain particularly with form that he has been in recently yeah it's a big blow I think Bruno one of his biggest strengths is he's always there for you he his appearance record has been brilliant for us um especially when you consider the the physical exertion that he commits to every game his training is very good he's he's he's been exceptional in every way so to lose him and he's a pivotal figure for us is going to be a big Miss but we have big players that can can fill his shoes as well so um whoever I choose in that position I think we've got quality players coming in and how do you balance that need to pick as strong a team as you possibly can but also maybe give minutes to players who need it because you've had a lot of games recently there are a lot more coming up and the changes you made on Saturday were made probably quite late in the game as well and it was another big physical effort yeah it was but I think you ask any player and I will ask every player how they are physically they'll all say they're fine to play um there'll be no issue so um The Players desire is always to play and we have to try and pick the best players physically for the game um it's a massive game for us we're under no Illusions um how big this game is for us this season so I think part of our strength recently has been the fact that we have been consistent with the team selection so let's see what we do final one League Cup semi-finals have played over two legs there is curiously a weight of about four or five weeks until the second leg at home but do you like the fact that you have two goes at this or would you prefer it to be a one-off not whether it's at home or away um is a one-off semi-final better do you think I'll tell you after the first game um I don't know I think I think it's quite an interesting Dynamic I I quite like it but I think um that this is an important game for us I think this sets up what's going to happen afterwards we need to be at our absolute best this is a high level game a lot at stake for both teams we need to be ready thanks R and you see um it's a high level game massive game with the run that you're on right now the the confidence that's going through the team what I suppose what that then does is it um heightens the sort of belief of the the support that you can get to the final you can you can go all the way is that something that the players are going to are going to have to deal with I think emotionally I think we two big highs in in recent games the Manchester United win and the Tottenham win they're big results for us um but I've seen a really good reaction to those wins nothing too um excitable from us which is great I think we need to become uh accustomed to playing in big games like this so I've seen a really sort of level response emotionally and it's just on now to the next one which is of course the Arsenal game when we look forward to and you're obviously you're missing Bruno for this this first leg but your your Midfield three or the three that you've chosen over the last few games um they've been getting a lot of credit EX thally I've had a few people saying that you know arguably the best Midfield three in the Premier League at this moment in time would you go along with that I'm not watching every Premier League game so it's a difficult one to comment on um I I love the three players we have in there at the moment I love the the three players that aren't in there at the moment as well that we have within the squad so um I think it's a strong area for us at the moment I think they're performing very well I think they're building really good relationships with each other that's why losing Bruno from that Trio will will be um A disruption doesn't mean necessarily negative for us but a A disruption to the normal Rhythm and how we've played in in recent games I think the biggest compliment I can pay them all is what they're giving us not just in possession which I think is the the easiest side of the game but off the ball I think they've been excellent they've helped us defend um lots of different situations really well and I think they're highly intelligent players delivering and playing well yeah I think it was a I think it was a stat I think I saw of match you today afterwards that your three midfielders were the with the top three in terms of their output out of possession the the ground covered across both teams in that game which I think you know just just says everything about what they're putting in yeah I think they're very good athletes that and they're aware of the importance off the ball sometimes you can get really good technical players that that's almost a secondary thought and they're not really interested but I think the the great thing about those three players is they all recognize that the team needs to perform in both phases of play um but they are very good on the ball as well and they've brought a calmness and a composure to our our buildup play which I think From This Moment hopefully will only improve as well I think we can get better in that respect but I've been really pleased with how they've formed their their way of working in uh in Alexander isach you've got a striker who's in red hot form at the moment scored in his last seven games um is he entering the field right now expecting to score do do you get that that vibe from him yeah I think I think he will naturally I think when you're on the Run of goal scoring um games that he is I think you you go in with a different Viewpoint than if you're not um I think the team most importantly is creating for him as well I don't think this is him doing it on his own I think the team's um playing in a really good way that's creating chances not just for Alex but for other players as well we're seeing goals come from different aspect of the team so I think when you go on the run that we've we've gone on you wouldn't be doing that if it was just down to one player so Alex is playing his part in that by finishing the moves off but um delighted with how the team's creating them for him just finally for me one one on transfers if if you don't mind there was a report um in Saudi Arabia over the last 24 4 hours that that Martin Martin Deka may be allowed to to leave after the the Arsenal game I know you spoke about him on on Friday and you said that you need to sort of respect his wishes in in this whole situation is there any is there any truth to that is has there been anything that's changed since since we spoke at the weekend no we're just concentrating on the game so I think we massive game against Tottenham now a massive game very quickly against Arsenal there's no talk of anything else other than the matches than thank you thanks Keith Leisha morning you said to raise that that you quite like the dynamic of of the two legs but how much does it change your approach because I guess obviously you want to win but the most important thing is putting yourself in a position to to win that second leg Yeah I mean I think it's uh you could talk about the the dynamic of the two games for at length but the reality is we're just playing another game we're playing an 11 V1 game for 90 minutes away from home and we've got to do all the same things that we've been doing well in recent games we've got to be really good off the ball we've got to be solid defensively we've got to pose Arsenal problems the other way so I think as long as we get that mix right I don't think we should overthink it um let's continue or try and continue the good performances we've given uh and give our absolute best to try and win the game I think you asked something similar at the weekend about what what's been the difference with with this fantastic run that you've been on because the win against Spurs was very different to the win against Manu how is this team finding ways to to win but also absorb you know the pressure that Totten put you under as well particularly in that second half well I think every Premier League game is so different the Tactical side of the game Manchester United to Tottenham they're two very different teams and you need to adapt to both teams so they're going to be different games um conceding early was a massive blow in the game a great response from the group to score so soon afterwards and to come back and win and win away from home isn't easy especially against the team of the quality of Tottenham so I just think every game we take independently um the Arsenal game now will be totally different again so we're going to have to adjust and adapt um and try and find a way to win win does the proximity of of two trips to North London very close together coming back in between has that had much of an impact on you and the players no I think we're used to it I think the traveling aspect is something you become accustomed to I mean I think we had to do that a lot of course last season in the Champions League and yeah getting used to that I mean obviously it's not out of the country it's a minimal travel really for us and we travel well so I'd expect that not to have an impact thank you thank you thanks we'll start with Damian would you like to start hey EDD how how do you think your team has developed since you got to the final of this competition two seasons ago developed since yeah um yeah I think we I think we've come a long way since then I think I was asked a question recently about the um the Champions League season and the team then and um I haven't watched the game back from That season for for a long time so sometimes your memory plays tricks with you in terms of what you delivered but I remember that team they' been very solid defensively [Music] um obviously we had a couple of different players in there as well so I think naturally that changes of the dynamic but I think we've come a long way I think our game's evolved um I certainly think we've evolved quite a bit tactically since then game moves on very quickly in the Premier League I say it all the time probably month by month it changes slightly so um you have to change with it so I think we've seen a a quite a consistent um changing in certain aspects of what we do you you've spoken in the past about part of this project being sort of to convince your big players that they can fulfill their dreams here do you do you think they're starting to believe that again uh yeah I hope so I mean I think it's a difficult a difficult question for me to answer I think the players are always the better ones to I can't answer on their behalf but I think they they seem happy at the moment um the group seems in a good place coming in training well um there's a positive vibe about the group of course we have big games and we're doing well in the big games at the moment so I think naturally that brings um a good feeling to to what we're doing but I think that it's a two-way thing of course we have to provide the right conditions for the players and um try and give them the right structure within the team for them to play well and enjoy their football um um but of course they have to do their part and they have to play well and um they certainly are at the moment thanks Dam we got Luke and then Craig please morning um one of your sort of standout quotes one of your rare standout quotes some would say um was that you'd uh you're you're not here to be popular or liked you're here to compete do you think this team's got that kind of mentality again the minute because you seem to be ruffling feathers everywhere you go at the moment ruffling feathers we certainly um want to be competitive yeah I mean I I think I've said many times I don't remember saying that quote um definely said it I'm sure I said it um but I don't remember saying it it certainly wasn't sort of meant to be a standout line but I'm pleased it's some people liked it because for me that's absolutely where we need to be um the competitive side of our game has to be there regardless of the opponent regardless of the competition we are here to try and win and that is ultimately what we're we're driven for um the popular stuff yeah I mean I don't really care what happens outside of Newcastle um the perception other teams have of us doesn't really worry me um it's all about us and making sure we're happy with who we are and happy with how we're performing quite nicely on to my second team what's this group like to manage as a bunch of characters um it's a it's a I think it's a great group of people um I enjoy coming in every day I'm very proud to represent them um of course you always have good and bad moments um and I think when you're managing a a team of I'm talking the players here just the players alone 30 players there's always going to be difficult moments to navigate um but I think they're very respectful generally and very humble as well want to learn and get better so I I really enjoy the day-to-day interactions that I have with I presume this as when you came to Newcastle this was the kind of games you wanted to see more regularly this is your second semi-final in three years you must be pleased that you're adding that kind of level of expectation where you get to these stages in competition yeah very much so I think the big games are what we what we train for and that that's what your everything you do during your playing career is to try and reach the Pinnacle and and experience the the biggest games and the best competitions now the champions league for us was an unbelievable experience we'd love to get back there again but it's very much the same with the the caribel cup final which was a I think looking back was a great experience but the experience ultimately was a negative one so we want to if we can um try and go back there and end up with a different result Craig morning Daddy from a coach's perspective this game it was was kind of different two years ago in Southampton because you went into it his favorites do you see tomorrow night is 90 minutes or 45 do you have have a different approach whereby you've got that second leg in mind or do you just go there you play your 433 you're attacking principles or do you do something different yeah I think that's a a good question I think for us we I think we're at our best when we just see the game and we don't overthink things I think there's a danger that you can tie yourself into knots um second guessing is yourself really it's a game of football it's 90 minutes yes of course that'll only be halftime and we'll have a second chance regardless of the outcome but I think a positive approach um seeing us play our way I think is our best chance of getting a positive result two weeks ago when you went into fifth we sat here and we spoke about the project and things which can make those top players stay here and we agreed on Champions League football would no doubt help with regards to cup as well and silver where how important is that in sending a message to those big players already at the club and potential targets outside you know you're just ending that run and bringing bringing back a trophy yeah I think it would no doubt help us in every respect um whether that's well whatever angle you you want to take but we can't concern ourselves with that and the outcomes it's all about right now we have Arsenal and that's hard enough so all our focus is going on to Tuesday's game and then we'll put it to bed and focus on the fa C we got Ian a menley morning uh Bruno as you said is has been a near ever present for for since You' been here since he arrived is it a simple case of bringing in a replacement and asking to to uh replicate the role or do you need to alter the midfields dynamic I I laugh because um almost trying to find someone to play like Bruno that that's that's not easy um but I do understand the direction of the question but no no two players are alike and is you have to look at the player that you you bring in and try and get him to play to the best of his ability suiting his his style really um so now I've got no doubt it would be a slight change for us um to be without Bruno only he can do what he does but that doesn't mean it can't be effective for the team whatever change we make um so we'll have to try and look at that and find the right balance to the team again cu the balance I think has been so good in the last few games that's why we've executed what we have so get in the balance of the team again with a new player coming in um or potential new players coming in is something we'll have to look at closely and uh in your own mind do you know who will replace him is it a very tight call between one of two players no it's a tight call I think we have probably three or four options that I could look at to uh to do that I think I've got a pretty good in my uh idea on my own mind which way I'll go but it is a tight call Eddie on the captain thing I mean you've got K and trippy in the dressing room anyway regardless of of who you pick how important is his experience going to be given all them big finals and Euro semi finals he's had with England Etc yeah I think we have a few players that have those credentials um trips is a player that always lends his experience to every every moment that we're in I mean he was a little bit ill before the Tottenham game but he was absolutely first class during the game helping players before the game during the game and afterwards first class professional um so he yeah he's been excellent the last few weeks coming back into the team and playing as well as he has but he always helps and and I think there's three or four others that have got those big game experiences that will naturally help as well but I think ultimately as a group I think we're pretty experienced now I think I don't look at that as a a weakness so uh I expect us to be ready for what's ahead on leis Miley I mean last season he had a dream season getting all those those firsts this season obviously he's gonna have to fight his way into the team have you had any sort of chats with him to try and reassure him that his opportunity will will come along yes I have of course regular contact with Louie I think he's in a good place he's come back from his injury and he's looked good he's trained now for a long period of time he's building robustness that only training for that length can give you um he's ready to play I'd say um I'd have no concerns about putting him into the team he's got that big game experience that you're talking about he's played in the Champions League at some really tough grounds and done very well so he's a valuable member of the squad and just on on transfers do you find yourself in a position where you Happ to talk about football logic to to some of the people around you or does the business bus logic have to come in because of the PSR and an unpopular departure might have to happen this month yeah I think the business logic is taking over um from the football logic I think that will be the way for not just for us but for lots and lots of clubs because there may be football decisions you'd like to make and we nothing i' think will be bigger than the the previous summer where we had to lose two highly promising young players we were forced to we had no choice um so that was very much the business taking over the football and I think we're still in that position to a degree thanks L we go Martin and then Chris morning Eddie morning a lot was made after your nil niler Arsenal in 2023 um uh there sorry those was criticism of your tactics at the time did that frustrate you back then just trying to think back um no I I don't think so as I said I think we we reflect a lot and analyze a lot of of what we do um tactically it's massive part of the game now so I think when you get a positive result like we did that night I think it was a good really good defensive performance maybe not so much attacking wise but defensively outstanding we did a lot right to get that draw um and then of course we consult with the people that we think matter and then the the outside opinion is almost irrelevant to us and a difficult question but is there any irony at all that Arsenal seem prepared to embrace more or less anything in their desire to win the Premier League this season what Arsenal do is absolutely up to them and um we know that this is going to be a really difficult game for us so um I got full respect for them and can you say what you're prepared to do or what you're prepared to give to win a trophy here well we we give everything I can guarantee that there'll be no um Stone left unturned in terms of our preparation and hopefully the execution from the players um so yeah we do everything can within the rules to to try and Achieve that Chris more Eddie one player who could come in the Midfield uh for Bruno is is Joe willick and obviously a former Arsenal player he's had his injury problems over the last 18 months two years where where is he at physically and I mean at the weekend he even ended the game had Center forward for you as well bit of a different yeah I thought he did really well when he came on on Saturday I was really pleased there was a moment in the G it was um quite a bit of time left with the extra time and Alex was physically done so I needed someone that I could trust tactically to play a certain role we asked him to do a job real job for the team for I don't know however long he was on with extra time he did it brilliantly and he showed his his sort of understanding of the game as at a really high level I think Joe is probably in his best condition than he's been for for a long time he's been able again to stay fit and train for a long period of time which he hasn't had for so long he's had very stopped to start time different injur injuries different problems um but I'd say he's an undoubted game changer for us he's got brilliant physical capabilities he's got a goal in him um he's creative so Joe will look at his best is a great asset for us to have and um yes I'm of course aware of the the Arsenal connections for him but he's just a great player in his own right and you've spoken quite a bit about Jacob Murphy and the impact he's made the team I mean that combination with him and Alexander isach he seems to be laying on a lot goals for him he seems to almost be a throwback in terms of being quite direct as a Winger in terms of getting to the B line Whi cross crosses in how different a dynamic does he bring to the team well he's a old-fashioned in the sense that he's a right footed player playing on the right hand side which I think is a good Dynamic for us um probably Jacob's standout quality is his Crossing ability very good whether it's high crosses low crosses he's got that ability to to drive in field and then take the line and produce for us and Alex has been the beneficiary of that on a number of occasions this season but not only that with Jacob I think tactically he's got a really high level understanding of what the game needs so we've asked him to do lots of various roles defensively he's delivered them absolutely brilliantly for us so very underrated in in that respect thanks Chris we've got Mark at the back and then Don please morning Eddie um the mood around the club is probably as high as it's been for maybe 12 15 months is there a real feeling around the club that you can do something really special in 2020 25 yeah I'd say the the the mood around the club if you're talking the training ground for for us which is of course where we spend most of our time is always been pretty consistent it's been good staff here are very very good very positive people the players have always been positive and even when results weren't so good and perceived negative responses around everything the players were very good had no issues with sort of our general feeling of course it helps when you win and that gives you a natural boost um so the players I'd say are yeah in a good in a good place at the moment but we know we we take nothing for granted every every game um you know we approach the same way um you you mentioned there a little bit about transfers the Market's been fairly quiet I think you mentioned a couple of months ago that you thought it could be another very quiet J is it going as you'd expected is though The Vibes that you're getting from the the market that it's going to be another yeah of course I'm not on the front line so I'm not necessarily speaking to agents and sort of getting the interactions and the feeling that other people at the club would that would have a far better understanding of that um but yeah I don't think it's taking too many turns away from what I thought the reality would be but that's not to say that anything is cut and dried because the transfer market like anything can be unpredictable it might just take one big move somewhere that sets a chain reaction off so uh we're we're ready for anything we're we're able to um I think think be flexible just finally from me as well um Sandro's performances have been so consistent and consistently excellent um since he's coming into the team I mean can you just give us an idea of a flavor of of how he is he seems a very level guy it doesn't seem like he's he sort of has these Peaks and troughs but um his performances have been so good like somewh kind of what he brings to the team and he's kind of emotional yeah I mean I said this many times last year when people would ask me about how he was handling the the difficult situation that he was in and I said he's you wouldn't really know he's just R level um he's just a very good professional he trained brilliantly last year and he's the exactly the same character that you saw in that difficult moment now and I think that's a great compliment to him because he's very focused on the future he's very focused on being at his best delivering what the team needs and I think you can see that in his performances he's bang on with the the small details he's bang on with helping the team defend and then of course his obvious qualities technical qualities come out and the way the midfields played he's been a huge role in that um delighted with how he's come into the team and how confident he looks at the moment morning Eddie um VR is in place tomorrow night's game for the first time in the competition this season trial of referees announcing decisions in the stadium do you welcome that change in that increased transparency or have you almost enjoyed not having V in the previous rounds um yeah I think I I it's interesting because the brenford game which is the last round was the brenford game The Last Round yeah um so many games uh I I I think I enjoyed not having VR in that moment and that's because we scored goals and you saw the linesman flag stay down and you think that's a goal you're not sort of second guessing cuz the first thing that I think now when we score is is is there a reason for that goal not to stand which takes away the enjoyment of the moment really um so that that's the world that I live in so when you don't have it and you score obviously it's a different feeling but if you don't have it and you concede then again I might be thinking the other way so you know it's I don't know I'm still of the train of thought I like the initial raar emotion you get when you score without V and just on injuries with Nick Pope is there any update on his situation could he be back for your next Premier League game yeah Nick's following um the track that he was on he's there's been no um setback he's on track for I think it was six weeks when he when he did the injury initially I think roughly um yeah he's doing well I'm sort of not in regular contact UM haven't seen him for a couple of days so I'll see how he is today next time we've got Kieran and then Jordan to wrap up please morning Eddie uh you got as mentioned a bit spiky a couple years ago at the Emirates um to the point where you even standing up for your team on the touch line do you want to see that side from your team again tomorrow I think you always have to stand up for each other um as long as it's in a controlled way don't want us to lose discipline in any way I think we've been pretty good with that this season um there there's a line I think in terms of your behavior that you don't want to cross um don't want to be Reckless but I think we have to be strong and Resolute and definitely protect each other on the pitch um and off the pitch you know in terms of our conduct it's got to be again strong and Resolute but not um yeah not Reckless and you I think have only won once of the Emirates is this a chance for you to make history you it seems the team don't travel in fear to these grounds anymore yeah I think well aware that you know there's there's certain records that we need to do better in you and that's obviously one that we're not um we haven't done well historically so we'd love to change that but yeah we can't talk about it we got to deliver it mon you just thought on Emil craft there's a chance he could be back tomorrow he's getting closer um he's done again crafty's done a lot of work the type of injury that he had meant that he could run quite early he could do everything other than the sort of the physical contact so he's yeah he's he's super fit um but we just need the bone to to heal before he can take that contact again play on the right side of that defense on on Saturday could we see more that going forward or do you prefer that right foot left foot to balance at the back um well I I spent most of my career playing on the left as a right footer so I'm not adverse to um utilizing players in in that in that position because I think it all depends on the player and his ability and com how comfortable he is to to do it I I think Sven has the capabilities of playing there long term because I think he's got a he's actually got a very strong right foot although you don't see it a lot when he plays on the left he's technically good with both feet I think it's just a new Dynamic for him and I think it will take a little bit of time before he understands the angles having not done it for for a long time but I'm not averse to anything that I think makes the team stronger
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,PmpaTSTW4jQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmpaTSTW4jQ,good morning Eddie um some recognition for you and a couple of your Players yesterday in the um short list for the Premier League monthly Awards obviously nothing um finalized or announced yet but it it must be nice and a sign that things are going well yeah always good to be uh um in the mix for these things because it means you've had a good month so delighted with that I think um it has been a good or was a good December for us now we need to try and make sure it's a good January as well there's obviously a lot of attention on everything Alexander isach does but for a player like Jacob Murphy who's come into the team recently and delivered so much for you how pleased are you for him that he has received that nomination for player of the month yeah I think Jacob's done really well I think um goals and assists is what every attacking player needs um in their game I think he's had a really strong group of games um the goals he scored I think have been really good finishes he's capable of that but he's always been a really creative outlook for us his Crossing ability is is second to none so yeah really pleased for him looking ahead to Tottenham this weekend you do have an issue at right sided Center back with Fabian Sher suspended Jamal lels um still recovering from injury what about Sven botman and the possibility of him coming back to the squad for this weekend yeah I always said Miss Fen I think he's in be in and around the Christmas games I think um he's worked incredibly hard to um get himself in a good condition he's had I think three games um a lot of internal training as well um some some match stimulus so he's certainly in and around my thoughts um I'll have to make a decision on who I think best fits that position uh but yeah great to have Sven in around unavailable again would it be a lot to put a player back in to such a big game or big couple of games with Arsenal on Tuesday as well after lengthy period out with that type of serious injury uh no because I think you go through a process with the type of injury that sven's had he's done an incredible amount of work it's not like he's um you know not had the training time with us we've taken longer than um maybe normally we would have done through respect for the injury that he had to try and make sure they had the best chance of staying fit and when he comes back hitting the ground running which is absolutely vital so uh I've got a decision to make in terms of Team selection but um if sven's in the squad it's because he's um fit and available another option is Lloyd Kelly who hasn't had much football this season how tough a time has it been for him because he was in the team at the beginning of the Season sometimes at left back sometimes at Center back but more recently his opportunities have been pretty limited yeah they have but I think that's been down to the form of the The Lads that have played I think um Lloyd is a versatile player can play as you say a number of positions um I think yeah the form of Dan and and Fabian at the heart of the defense has been really strong especially of late I think we look good defensively so I think that's always a position that is difficult for me to rotate too much um I prefer to keep it settled back for and not to chop and change I think that your stability your team is based on relationships but Lloyd's training hard he's he's training very well um and he's waiting for his chance finally what sort of match are you expecting from from Spurs uh yeah difficult game I think whenever you go to Tottenham you know it's always a a tough match I think they a very good creative team I think their goal scoring records very strong um they've got a a very good way of playing which is tough to play against um so no we expect a really difficult game I don't think you're under any Illusions when you're playing the games that we are Manchester United Tottenham Arsenal that this is a challenging period but one that we started in in great form and now we're looking to carry that one thanks Ros Keith um given the way your side are playing right now and the reasons you just said to razor there the way Sports play they open up very expansive is this actually quite a a good game for for your side right now given the the attacking form that your side are in and you probably expect that sort of match against SPS um I don't know whether it be a good game for us or not until afterwards I I think it will be an exciting game I think I think they always are against Tottenham I think we've historically had some great matches against them both teams have had their their moments in in those games um one thing I think is sure they're not going to change their attacking approach and it's been very effective for them in front of goal they've been you look at their numbers very very good uh so I think for us as always when you go away from home there's the challenge to um nullify what they do and then impose ourselves onto them and as you say our attacking players are also in good form we look like we've had a really good feel about the team mentally I think we're in a good place so I think we um need to roll into the game and try and continue on good form it feels as though you've maybe gone up a notch in the last two wins against Aston Ville and Manchester United have you hit your straps yet or do you feel there's still more Improvement to come from your team uh I'd always say there's there's room for more I I have you have to believe that and and I do genuinely believe it anyway I think there's more to come um I think we're playing of course a lot better I think the cohesion in the team has been really strong um players are playing with confidence and freedom and expressing themselves in a in a great way but as the challenges go up we're going to need to deliver more and the these next games that we have coming up will challenge us more um and we're going to have to respond in in a positive way you spoke a b Lloyd Kelly a moment ago would you be would you be comfortable bringing in another Central Defender a left sided Central Defender to play alongside Dan like you don't it's weird in football you don't often see two left sided Central Defenders as partners I don't know why you see it was right sided quite often but not his left is that something you you'd be comfortable to do if he is the one that you you opt for yeah you're absolutely right and it's a bizarre way that that falls you very rarely you have seen it but you very rarely see two left Footers but two right Footers are actually quite standard and normal so um as I said earlier I'm going to have to make the right call what I believe is the right call for this game there of course there's going to be a change because Fabian who's been really consistent for us will be missing but whoever I pick will have their unique skill set um added to the team and we have to try and look at it as a positive and a first game um watching on for the the New England manager Thomas Tuco tomorrow it's been widely reported I guess an early opportunity for for your players a few few of them have been included in recent squads to stake a a claim and an impress yeah I'm sure the players will be aware of that but I think for me it's irrelevant it's us against Tottenham and we've got to make sure that we turn up in the the same place really that we were against Manchester United and on the front foot and try and deliver a good performance thanks good Andy uh get the important question out the way first excellent festive period for Newcastle but did Jason Tindle gift you a Wham hoodie over Christmas or not no he didn't no no absolutely not no he's quite selfish like that with his clothes um he has his unique fashion sense and it's a very strong one but he doesn't share sorry to hear it um we'll move on to the football anyway you talk about the psychological impact on Monday night of that game and that win against Manchester United what has been the psychological impact and have you seen that this week on the training pitch I think you always see off the back of a win you you see a just a slightly different mood um a bounce in the lad step um laughter humor and that that's great and and that's that's what we're obviously here for but then you need the focus on the next game and I've also seen that and the focus has to come very quickly because um you can't live off what you've done in this group of games and we need to almost forget that take the confidence but forget the results and make sure that we're going into this game with a Clear Vision of what we need to do because this will uh this will be a tough test I saw St the other DAV Newcastle had scored more in December than they had between August and December so just on the front three in the attacking form of newas what has clicked for you I I don't I don't think necessarily as I said many times to that question I don't think there's one thing I think it's a combination of things um certainly those players I think now are going into the games and just in a different frame of mind which only comes from winning and feeling good um but I do think the combination of things to score goals you need the team to perform um you need the Defenders to use the ball well you need the Defenders to attack well you need need to have a confidence in each other because you need to um also from our perspective get more we needed to get more Bodies In The Box we needed to um play with a little bit more freedom I felt so a huge knock on effect and then you're going into the next game in a different place mentally and um but as quickly as it can come as quickly as it can go so we need to um not lose sight of that and continue to do the basics well course January transfer window three years AG go there were plenty of signings of course man it was a busy old January the likes of Bruno Kieran is Dan burn up there with one of your most important signings that you've made bearing in mind his recent form bearing in mind his versatility over the course of three years yeah without a doubt I think Dan's been incredible I think I've said before I think he's been even better than I thought he he would be and I mean that as an absolute compliment because we knew he was a talented player we knew he would be um a Difference Maker for us just with his stature in his size and and everything that he brings in that respect but then when you add the the leadership skills that he's brought to the group the consistency not just a performance but of selection um he's been a a tower of strength in the dressing room he's always a positive force uh he's been absolutely fundamentally important in everything that we've done and hopefully will continue to be just finally talk about the defense how else is Newcastle looking team newswise ahead of Tottenham tomorrow I think we're okay I don't see any major concerns from our our last game I'm just trying to think if I'm missing something but now I think we're okay thanks thanks Andy Nisha morning Eddie the results that you've had over the festive period the manner in which the team have played is this the best Newcastle United under you so far um that's a tough question um I'm not sure I I don't know um I'd like to think it's getting close to being near near our best I think we've produced some very good performances previously some some games that everything's really clicked in that respect and we've looked a good team attacking wise and but of course I think the most pleasing thing about our recent run together with the goals has been how good we've been defensively how well we' protected our goal I think we played with a lot of control in that respect so I've been delighted um but yeah the challeng is always to keep it going and that's very difficult a lot of talk rightly so about Alexander eak and I think at the start of the season I asked could he win the Golden Boot he's in the mix but how good could he be it's quite a consistent question I get on Alex and I think he yeah he could be he could be anything that he wants to be I mean he's got a little bit of everything in his game which makes him so difficult to play against um I don't think there's one dimension of his game that he he can't do to a very good level I think his challenge is teams will look and try and find a way to to stop him continually um that'll be a big Focus I'm sure for the opposition's preparation and his challenge is to continue find a way to hurt the opposition uh and to evolve his game and continue to improve we've spoken about Miguel alon's future quite a bit in here I think um Charlotte FC and America have gone on record to say they want him can you just give us a bit of an update on his future well his future is very much here at the moment I think migy has trained brilliantly this season um he's ready to play and he's an important player we we're not um blessed with a huge number of uh wide players um so anyone that we have here is um vitally important and mig's always proved for us how effective he is when he does play so um I'd say the same for any player until the day that they leave their their future is here and he needs to focus on the next game similarly um we've talked about Martin Deker and his future and he is playing in goal at the moment so you've said you don't want to lose him can we just have a bit of an update on Nick Pope's injury Nick um is starting goalkeeping work so he's back on the grass um diving Etc he's still not fully training with the group so I I still got a little bit of time to go but I think his knees in a good place thank you Thana Damian go Lee Ryder and then Ian merer hi hi can just go back to Sven I think when when he's injury first emerged you told us that he had the option of trying to manage it and play through it or have surgery and he oped for the form and it didn't work out for him but what impact has that had psychologically and have you had to talk to him about no I think there was a period where of course he was disappointed because he was desperate to stay fit he had a lot to be fit for um had the Euros coming up it was a massive part of our season so I think there was he was making every effort could to stay fit and available for for us in our pursuit of what we wanted to achieve That season so it was a massive blow to lose him and I know how disappointed he was but I think once the operation was agreed by all parties I think he then quickly got his head round that a long period of work you know sven's a very dedicated professional he's very focused on his career he wants to do well so he's gone through a huge amount of work to get himself in the position that he is now and he looks good as I said he's been training for a period of time yes he hasn't had the sort of the the match day experience with the with the team yet but he's done everything else but that and I think he's um I think he's physically in a very good place just on a different topic when when you hear pundits saying Arsenal should go and offer Newcastle whatever they want for Alexander eak or Manchester City should go out and sign Bruno gim do you find that disrespectful I think it comes with the territory now to be honest I think maybe in my very early days that would have maybe left more of a i' have had more of an impression on those those comments but I think when you're in the position that I'm in now you sort of ignore it and it's irrelevant there'll be so much talk and noise and rumor and you can't control it all and you can't even begin to try so you just have to ignore it and just focus on the facts I think thank you L yeah just to follow up on that you had the fan base was actually irked quite a lot by that yesterday because you had Paul meren seem to have this notion that Arsenal can come and just pick and choose who the want I mean what's your sort of response to that notion well yeah first I'm hearing of of it Le so I'd probably need to see the comments but our our players are um loved by us um Wanted by us and you know we've got massive games to come and we need to we need them to perform so their focus can only be on what they're delivering in the here and now we can only control what we can control um but I don't see that being an issue for us especially in this window um we've got so many big games to come we're very focused and the players are very focused on having a great season and uh that's all that concerns us at the moment you've already mentioned that other Premier League teams aren't going to do Newcastle of favor so I guess the same service gets applied back to anybody thinking we're certainly not looking to help anybody out that's for sure we it's a hard enough league as it is to um be consistently successful um but we certainly need our best players here just on on the Spurs game um recently Spurs manager saying talking about entertainment and winning games 43 I mean what what's your idea of entertainment do you want to be hanging on in games or and and providing an entertaining match or would you rather just get the the job done no I think we have I've always said I think we have a duty to try and entertain but yeah clarifying that is is is maybe not as simple um I want the supporters to come and genuinely look forward to seeing the team play genuinely be excited about what could happen and I think we've got some great great players in the team I think bring that quality because you're sort of what's going to happen next are they capable of something uh truly inspiring so I I want that feeling for the supporters to watch the team of course our job is to try and produce a winning team while doing that and that's um that's always the challenge but yeah I think is important to me that everyone enjoys watching us play Can Can I just check one one thing as well very quickly uh in terms of the style of player you might be looking to bring in one of the players linked was Jack Gish in the last 48 hours obviously you're not going to mention him but is it that type of player that you you could bring in have you got the capacity to do that financially yeah uh I don't believe currently we have but uh I think we're not really looking uh at the moment or concentrating at the moment on incomings uh we're focusing on the massive games we have ahead of us that's the only thing that I'm concentrating on thanks L go to Ian then Craig and Chris good morning Eddie morning Eddie earlier you talking about the squad as a good field to the place now and you said we'll roll into the the Spurs game looking to maintain your form that's not the language Amanda who wasn't supremely confident of his players right now would use well I think that that's psychologically the best way for us to prepare the game in my opinion I think that doesn't mean we won't do our preparation we'll do our preparation on Tottenham as thoroughly as we would for any other opponent um we'll go into the game I think fully prepared as we always do our preparation doesn't change but I think psychologically for the players when you're in a good moment you don't want to destabilize that you just want them to um roll into the next game to some extent in the same place and uh try and deliver a great performance on the goalkeeping front Eddie um at Liverpool when Allison was out and kello was playing very very well but Don slot made it clear that that the number one was still Allison is your number one still clearcut I don't think I have to go into that conversation today I think um Martin has been excellent for us uh in every respect of his game I think he's looked very supremely confident which is never easy for someone who hasn't played for such a long period of time um his distribution of the ball has been high level I think he's made important saves when we've needed him to um he's definitely contributed to our team's played um but Nick is a first class goalkeeper um with his unique skill set um and it's great to have two high Lev go goalkeepers uh at the same club and and is a is the age a factor for you with goalkeepers in the same way it might be for all few players in what sense well uh mon they're both in the 30s and uh de braa 36 yeah but what you in what what you um a lot of a lot of managers for outfield players they there'd be once a player passes 30 or maybe 32 they'd be looking to replace them but it's it's probably less obvious with the keepers yeah I think it is I think with the goalkeeper I think you you view them differently with age of of course their physical demand is much less um but of course they still need their agility um and their ability to make big saves and that's probably their most important um attribute I think both our goalkeepers um still have that thanks Craig morning Eddie A lot has been made of the the guys going forward and the goals which have been scored but amidst all of that you've kept four clean sheets on the bounce now at the back can you take us inside from a coach's perspective what makes the difference there because if you rewind a year when you went down in Liverpool you con see that a Premier League record high number of shots on goal now you're not conceding any shots on goal and is the key to defending almost not having to to defend if that team is functioning just from a c's perspective can you take us inside that thanks for bringing that St up Craig that's a a nice reminder of that night um I think yeah I think the the work and the the processes we go through with our defensive structure don't really change that much um of course the delivery of that sometimes can be very different you know what you see on a on a weekend I think a lot of that depends on your opponent and their qualities I think in the last four games we've defended our goal really well I don't think we've conceded too many shots as you say or too many chances against but that doesn't have any guarantee for the next game uh and every game is is so different so I think the challenge for us is the mindset and the um the concentration we have to actually defend our goal and the willingness to defend our goal against brenford we didn't have it um we I was really disappointed with our defensive output that day it was it was not what I wanted to see from the team um but it's been a much better response you saw against Manchester United the chances they did have we were throwing our bodies in the way and looked like we had a great desire to defend and I think they're the most important qualities rather than the necessarily the the Tactical Viewpoint like I said right right now you are marrying the two going forward and going back over when you were at Bournemouth there was this idea that you were an attacking coach and the team didn't defend as well and please take this question in the spirit it's meant but were you a bad defensive coach or was that a me oh that's a yeah I won't take that in any way other than the way you meant it CG um um no I think you always evolve as a as a coach I don't think certainly my I'm not the same I don't have the same view on the game that I did say five six years ago but I think if I did there'd be an issue because I think you're always changing your Focus changing the things that you think are the most relevant to your team and of course that depends on who you're managing and who you're coaching but there's always believe it or not we've always had a big focus on the defensive side of the game and I think you have to because I think it' be negligent not to um but the delivery of that is all down to it's all down to the players that's not kid ourselves if you don't have good Defenders and you don't have a good Midfield structure to Def protect your defense you're going to concede goals if your goalkeeper is not playing well you're going to concede goals so um the players have had a a good response in the last four games but our challenge is to keep that going thank you got to Chris Jordan and then Aaron more Eddie you mentioned Martin's distribution I mean with his feet he seems to have almost become like an additional Outfield player can you just talk about that as a sort of Dimension and what that's sort of added to to the team as well in your general play yeah Martin's always been very good with his feet I think that's one of his his biggest strengths but I think the modern day goalkeeper now live in that world where they're viewed um their distributions viewed with equal importance as their ability to keep the ball at the net and I think um Martin's played his part in that respect uh re really well in terms of helping us have control especially when you go to Old Trafford that's um a big part of the game that we we tried to focus on and I thought he did give give us that that um ability to play and to build our attacks and to make it difficult for them to get to our our center backs from the pressing Viewpoint so uh yeah Tottenham are a very good pressing team a very good team off the ball so that's going to be a different dimension for us again coming into this game and just on the Midfield three uh Jimmy Cara said it compares to any Midfield in the Premier League and I know that there was a lot of excitement when that three first put together and maybe it didn't quite fully gel in the way that it is now can you just talk about the the blender between the three of them and why you think they are complimenting each other so nicely at the moment yeah I do think they've got different strengths which I think is really important I don't think you want a carbon copy of the same three players um I don't think that's the way to get a the right balance within that um area of the team I think they're all very good physically which is hugely important in the Midfield battle these days that their ability to run big distances all three of them actually is very good um Sandro brings a bit more um speed to the Midfield which I think again is a really key Dynamic um and of course Joey's got his physical skills which we you need both in open play and set plays so I think it's a good mix and of course Bruno's got his obvious quality so but I'd say the same looking at Joe Will's got this the speed Viewpoint Sean Long staff's got the intelligence um and brings a different Dynamic when he plays so I think and of course Louis Miley brings his qualities I think within the six midfielders we've got I think we've got very different players but they will bring something unique to the team thanks Chris Jordan hi you just going back to Mart I appreciate this is quite hypothe hypothetical but if Nick was to return in January could Martin leave because there's a lot of noise from Saudi Arabia talk of terms of grade de great with Newcastle could he leave what what what is the situation with him as he almost played himself position where you can't let him go yeah I think the the situation with Martin is we would not want him to leave um um but of course you have to respect and understand the players wishes as well in this it's not as clear-cut as everyone would would necessarily have you think Martin is out of contract as well in the summer so that's a different Dynamic to add into the mix but it's all hypothetical Martin is and has been fully committed I think he's been outstanding he's been a brilliant professional to work with um got a lot of respect for him and uh I think he's done really well when you consider he didn't have a lot of football when coming into the team so all you know fair play to him and how he's handled that situation just going back to ke question ear about the two left footed Center half almost feels like an Unwritten rule weirdly but given you've got three three left footed Center off F Dan um who Lloyd as well sorry could you play three left foot cent off going forward three sorry you can play three that be a new one Craig might have more to more to say about that um I think with our two right side Center harves being out Fabian suspension and M injured um it's going to be difficult to find a right-sided solution I think okay Aaron and then Kier morning Edie just another one on Deka um you've spoken there about his distribution and how good it is in the modern game and in your teams how important is that for goalkeepers to be able to sort of zip it about at the back like that yeah I'd say it's an important aspect of the game but it's not the um it's not the only criteria for a goalkeeper you know goalkeepers have to be multi- talented these days I think when I was first coming into the game myself as a professional the back pass Ru had sort of just come in and it it totally revolutionized the role of a goalkeeper really in their skill set um but I think we have very good goalkeepers that can do a little bit of everything um certainly that's been a feature of Martin's game in the in the last few games and just on uh injuries q and trip came off the other night look like you was hold as hamstring is there any update on that yeah I think kieran's okay I think it's a bit bit of fatigue in the last two games I don't think there's any muscle problem there thanks Dominic you mentioned before seever M with Mont Deka but you've got several players out the contract in the summer obviously the rules they're free to agree deals with clubs foreign clubs this month does that make the need to tie players down to new contracts particularly pressing at the moment yeah I mean I think the ones that we would begin negotiations with of course we would want to get a quick solution with them um but it's all a delicate balance as we've said many times with um the financial conditions that we're working towards so let's see what happens with those it's a cliched term but is the return of Sven botman the closest thing you can expect to a new signing this month yeah it is a cliche but it's I think it's a good one um I think it was the same with Sandro when he came back from his ban where although he'd been training with us and he'd been with us for for a season it was like a new signing um and it actually gave the lads a big big lift to have Sandy Back available for selection and Sven will be exactly the same he's been player massive player for us a player that the lads all like um they like to play with they got total trust in him so when he comes back into the group it does give everyone a great feeling so um yeah I think that's a good way of looking at it thanks time Gary try one next um massive week coming up and obviously fighting on threee front I believe top four rival tomorrow The two clubs is this the biggest week of the season so far for you well I think it is the biggest week of the season because it's the one in front of us um but this not lost on us the importance of the next group of games and we're looking forward to itol just found one for me obviously a new year can 2025 be the one where Newcastle are in a position to deliver that long awaited silverware to the supports well we hope so um we don't shy away from the fact that that's our goal that's what we want to do that's what we everyone connected with the club is desperate for I know the players have got um got that in their sights and that's what they're desperate for as well so um but we know that you you can't really focus on the the end point of that you have to focus on trying to get there so for us it's the final and um you know the two games against Arsenal will take on all the importance after the Tottenham game but until then it's all focused on the Premier League and and trying to get another win
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,2YvIHqbcSM4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YvIHqbcSM4,yeah they're very difficult fixtures I think regardless of when you go um but I think for us I think we're just trying to attack the game in our way as we have done in recent weeks I think we've had um really good preparation to our games that the players seem to be enjoying themselves and entering the game in the right frame of mind to play and we've got to try and hit that sweet spot again um without any distractions I'm sure the players will be ready for the games I think when we play at our best we do share the goals around I don't think there's ever been one consistent source and we don't want there to be because then it's easier to stop for me it's about the team functioning and and enabling everyone to be creative and productive so we're seeing different players contribute in different games that pleases me no end of course Alex being our number nine will want to score um but for me I want uh goals from a huge range of different players and I think we're seeing that and that's that's great for us yeah absolutely I think if you can the ideal is that you're not subjecting the same players to 90 minutes every every game I don't think that's going to do anyone any good at this stage of the season when the games come thick and fast as they are so given a chance to take Anthony off Anthony off or Alex off at any time I I will try and take that opportunity um while giving players opportunities to play as well that are desperate to play but what I can't do is do it to the detriment of the team I've got to get the balance right and um I was pleased with the subs impact against Aston Villa Dam yeah very pleased with Martin I think it's never easy to come in for for a goalkeeper in any situation when you haven't played for a while because again it's about Rhythm and it's about confidence but Martin's picked it up from minute one I think he's distributed the ball really really well that's been a huge thing in his game I think that's always always been there I think against Aston Villa think back to a number of aerial claims catches that he's that he's taken Under Pressure he's dealt with that aspect really well too so um I'm really pleased with Martin I'd say low maintenance um which is great from my perspective he's he's not someone that um needs a massive amount of contact time from me he works really really hard with the goalkeeper coaches in his training um Adam and Schwan care about all the goalkeepers that they have uh of course they at times have to prioritize the work with the goalkeeper that's playing but I see Martin at his maximum level every day and he's because of that training attitude then when he does get to come into the team he can hit the ground running as he has um obviously two seon you got the Champions League last season got the champions leag you can't get in there this year probably even more than the last two Citys could there te I think there's always an opportunity um but I get your question this year seems unpredictable um in terms of results you see Chelsea lose today and um there's upsets most weeks I think that's great for the Premier League I said this before I think it's great for the Premier League that you never quite know what's going to happen that unpredictability I think brings excitement and I think the challenge for us is to be the team that is consistent and to be the team that can produce results when not expected and I think we're going into a round of fixtures now which will really test us um but it will probably be the one of the deciding factors on where we finish uh we're going to some tougher way grounds um but we look forward to those and try and continue on good form and you touch there on kind ofh actually the last two or three games and you know not your te but it feels like at the moment it's it's barely easy to pick your te which it hasn't necessarily been at various stages of season has felt like players made themselves unable if you like I know you say no one's at the moment really to be yeah no I agreee with the question I think early season I was chopping and changing because I wasn't happy with what I was seeing and then you it's a vicious circle because then um I I was carrying on chopping and changing because I wasn't happy again the ideal situation is that you're seeing what you like and you don't make too many changes to that team and if you do um you're bringing in someone who's ready to take their chance as well you're not making wholesale changes cuz that's never good for the rhythm of the team so um the team's picking itself to a degree with how we're playing at the moment um and obviously I hope that continues well I think every every time you play is an opportunity that I've always had that belief as a player as a manager that you never know what's going to happen it's a blank canvas what can we achieve in this in this game that's going to be down to our attitude firstly um I think it's a fixture that we should try to attack um give our best try and keep the Rhythm and momentum that we've got um and show the best version of ourselves I think we have to be ourselves in this game there's no point and this is our attitude wherever we go we have to we have to know what Newcastle is going to turn up we've seen that in recent weeks and it's been a real positive for well I hope that we are hungry and I hope we are looking forward to this game and I hope we're ready for it because um it's a big test for us it's a a big opportunity as I said a second ago and we'll try and grab it if we can Craig and finish any Approach at the end of the reflect on this s thing Alex rank in World football now Strikers B right now what would you say that's not something I waste my time thinking about to be honest I understand that you have to um no I think my biggest thing with Alex is of course I'm evaluating his game on daily basis weekly basis and I just want to try and push him for more um I'll let everyone else see where he is in the pecking order of of world football for me his game's in a good place at the moment but my job is to to not sit back and appreciate that my job is to try and find areas that he can improve push him towards that um and never stop pushing him because um he has all the all the ingredients in there um but football never stops changing and evolving and he needs to evolve and change with it I'm sorry on that your comp I I think you did but I I backed it up you with it I went along with it definely help us out is there anyone who Alexander ISS you of you put me on the spot there um no not not off the top of my head that I can go right for me he's that kind of player for me when I first saw Alex I I was instantly taken with his game I I loved how he played the game how he expressed himself and I still enjoy watching can play even as his manager now and I enjoy his aspects of his game greatly and um but as I say I have a different view to it than most people because I need to find the things that's going to make him better and I can't stop on his behalf simar is can usand I he's he's he's calm he's cool he he is what you see on the pitch um he doesn't really get flustered or overly emotional which I think for a striker is a great quality because he's that coolness that you see and calmness in front of goal is part of his personality and it's what makes him the player that he is he seems to have an extra half a second when other players don't um but I also think with Alex he does want to improve and this is the the beauty of his attitude is that he when we give him information and we're talking to him about his his game he's responsive he's not a close shop he's not in any way thinking that he's arrived at a certain place and that's it he knows that he has to keep adding to his game um Premier League Defenders are trying to stop him so the challenge is great for him to continue to score freely as he is now if there was percent terms I don't know I I think there's a lot more to come from him uh our job is to help him deliver that but of course the the main responsibility is on Alex to keep his Focus ignore all the plaudits and I'd say the same if he had a bad moment ignore any criticism stay focus on what you're doing of course he's got to play his part in helping the team he can't be selfish it's got to be about the team and it's about Newcastle and he plays his part more than anyone in that last yeah I think whenever you get a statistic like that you of course you want to change it I think the Aston Villa one coming here today was hit at me a number of times before the game but it doesn't really mean anything uh we still have to play the game and we have to this a unique game and we have to try and win it and that will be the same for Manchester United
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,1Zml11ZrHcA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Zml11ZrHcA,good morning Eddie I just want to check on the fitness of a few players firstly Joe willik who was substituted in the second half at IP switch but he received treatment shortly before then is he okay no injury as far as I know he's fine yeah I think he on shooting I think he just his head took a little bang to the floor but I think he's fine how important to keep him fit for a prolonged spell because he's had such a a difficult couple of years being in and out of the team with multiple injury problems and you'll want to run in the side won't he yeah he will I think you're absolutely right to keep Joe Fit For A sustained spell is now really important I think he's done the hard work to get back fit after a a really difficult time for him and he's been missing a long long time so for him to get back to his very very best levels I think will take a period of um regular games um but I think he's moving in the right direction now um so the last thing he needs is any kind of setback at this stage such an important player brings his unique qualities we want to keep him available how is Nick Pope doing he's doing okay yeah um he was given a time frame initially where he had to rest he's had a couple of injections in his knee it's feeling better it's feeling strong um quite when he'll be fit is still a difficult one to give a definitive Daye on and lastly on injuries and fitness EML craft who you've been without for a few weeks with a with a nasty injury um how is he doing in in his recovery and when do you anticipate him being available yeah amil's working well um his injuries uh yeah it was it was a serious enough injury I mean he's had an operation but he's now back on grass he's running the big thing for him will be contact and when we introduce him back into um the type of training that of course will test the injury the most but the good news is he's fit running um and looking good Aston Villa then on boxing day the match at St James's Park last season was a big victory for you both teams um put a lot into it certainly in terms of attacking football what do you remember about that game and the way that your team performed yeah I think the first game of the season is always a um always a big occasion I think I remember both teams played well actually I thought Aston Villa played well we of course played well with the with the goals that we scored but it was a tight game don't think the score line necessarily reflected the competitiveness between both teams um I thought we had two two good games obviously against Aston Villa last year but I think recognize the strength and the qualities that they possess and of course the season they had last year was very good from their perspective they've carried that one this year in the various competitions they're on so I think it's going to be a really good challenge for us just expanding on that last point I know they had a a difficult run of results until recently but a big victory at the weekend over Manchester City how well do you feel they have coped with the extra pressures and demands of having Champions League Football on top of the domestic action yeah yeah I mean it is a a big demand as we know from last year um I think they've dealt with it very very well I think they're they've got good depth in their squad they got some really good players um that they can pick and choose from so they can um rest players and and take players in and out but I think the way unai gets his teams to play um their style is very difficult to play against um very well coached very well drilled um we expect a good game and lastly you go into to the post Christmas set of fixtures in really good shape after the results and the performances I know you're focusing firstly on Villa but how um significant do you feel the next couple of weeks will be with Villa Manchester United Tottenham and then Arsenal coming up some big games for you yeah it's a big run of fixtures I think every reason for us to be excited about those games uh off the back of the recent ones that we've played I think we've hit a good consistent run of form I've been really pleased with how we played within the games our style our creative output's been much better so I think we uh we need to take that mentality into the next group thanks res Alan SKS morning Eddie morning um just following up first of all on injury Joel Linton is he likely to be back for boxing day yeah we we hope so I think we'll have a look at him today he had various facial injuries after the the last home game against brenford which he came off um couple stitches in and around his ear so we'll see how he is today uh do you enjoy this period we talked about the exciting games coming up here um and obviously when you're winning matches it makes it seem a little bit easier yeah winning changes everything I think um I'll enjoy the Christmas period if we're successful if we don't then I probably won't but uh I don't think that's different to any other time of year to be honest when you're you're in the line of work that we are confidence plays such a big part in football I mean look at Alexander e with his with his hattrick now do you do you see that exuding from from players when these sort of uh things are happening hat tricks for the first time for him yeah I think so I think it just changes the players feel and their emotions I think the challenge for us is to try and get everyone in the best frame of mind possible um I think we've seen from the whole Squad uh an improvement from the start of the season to now I think we're in a much better place um but it's important that we don't get distracted especially at this time of year the focus is on the games we've got some brilliant games on on paper for for everyone to really attack and to enjoy but we'll only enjoy them if we're at our best consistency is a word that's been used an awful lot of in the city I suppose is it's easier said than done though isn't it to to put put together this run to result in such a tough Premier League yeah this year more than any other it seems not just for us but for most teams I think we're seeing good results followed by indifferent results and spells of winning spells of not winning um and I think we find ourselves grouped together with a lot of other teams in that respect now the most successful teams this season of course are going to be the teams that find a way to win sometimes when you're not playing well um digging out results in difficult grounds and difficult places so we're in that period where we are playing well and we want to keep that going um yeah and try not to uh fall into the Trap that we fell into in previous spells did do records mean anything to you against Aston Villa don't think you've lost at St James's Park since 2005 against Villa and some great games and big results against them as well yeah I always think the previous games tell you something but they don't tell you anything about what's going to happen in the future we've seen different um results going into uh future opponents and I don't think they have any bearing on what's going to happen so I think just for us we you know we've really enjoyed playing at home the last few games I think our our home performances in the main have been very good so um more of the same in that respect will be more than welcome so the players in training on Christmas Day is that in the morning do they get time with the family after that or have you got to convene and keep them together or no we we'll get them in training of course but uh we won't keep them for any longer than they need to be at the train training ground uh and then they can enjoy Christmas like everybody else and just finally for me on the on the January transfer window you I think you said previously you've got to concentrate on on the players that you have rather than looking externally do you still see that as being the case yeah I do um until that reality is different for me it's always the same it's that's concentrate on the players we have we have a very good squad my job is to try and get the best out of every single person within that Squad that'll be my focus going into January um if that changes then great but um if not then we'll uh carry on working thank you Andy morning Eddie you talk about the Players Christmas Day what about yourself once you get away from here what's an Eddie how Christmas day look like any how Christmas traditions in the family or not uh there's a couple of traditions yeah which are probably keep to myself um but now be very much I'm sure like everybody else's I think they uh of course with a house of three three boys a dog um my wife it will be um focusing on on the kids and making sure that they enjoy themselves and um very special Christmases and we've enjoyed our Christmases up here as well I think they've been uh really memorable for us but of course in the back of my mind is always the work and always the games making sure the team's prepared um we've left no stone on turn in terms of our preparation um we treat every game the same regardless of when it is we'll get back to the football then Alex e that you've been asked a lot about Alex about just how good he is but looking ahead how much better does he need to be to kind of become the world's best do you think what extra does he need to add to his game now to kind of take him into that next level of a Stratosphere yeah I think it's about just refining I don't think it's changing his his game is very very strong in almost every Department I don't see a a weakness in his game um but I think it's refinement is it's shaving off the edges um trying to improve in the the small areas that he can and of course I'm a big believer as you know on Player Development and um the evolution of a player's game so you can never be the same player for for two seasons in a row you have to find different ways to hurt the opponent because teams of course with the analysis now they they find ways to try and deal with certain problems that you give them so for Alex that would be a constant thing that has to has to be in his game but I think it is and he's got that unpredictability that makes him very difficult to play against Alex obviously impressed on on Saturday as did Jacob Murphy once again does every Squad need a Jacob Murphy classifying it as a Jacob Murphy made me laugh um I think every Squad needs players with those qualities I mean I've always said Jacob's very selfless he's um of course he's driven himself indiv has individual Ambitions but he always plays for the team um very unselfish really takes a a buzz out of creating a goal um and he's always been that way just as much as he does from scoring and so his uh cross early in the game for our first goal his back heel of course well talked about and deservedly so was an incredible piece of skill um so I think those qualities yes every Squad needs and just finally with the utmost respect to the leicesters and the IP switches of the world is it it a game against a side like Villa who like Alan Merena coming into this one off the back of that Manchester City win is it games like this one that's really truly going to tell you if this side is turning round its form right now to a degree yeah I couldn't disagree with that I think we have to as I said earlier find a way to win against any opponent and I think by and large our form this season against the the teams that are doing well in the league has been pretty strong um but we haven't sort of done it in long periods so for three games yeah the last three games has been great but um we need a longer period of wins to really climb the table and be where we want to be thanks Anisha morning Addie morning um just following on from uh what you mentioned talked about with Raz about this busy run of fixtures we've heard over the years lots of managers complaining about too many games over the festive period but when you're in this kind of form compared to last time when you had the international break which did take the wind out the sales are you particularly looking forward to such a busy run yeah I I've always as a player I enjoyed the Christmas schedule and as a manager I'm exactly the same um I think they're unique games I think the the atmosphere is slightly different and I think when you're playing at home these games over the festive period are brilliant things to be a part of so yeah we're looking forward to the games um and I think when you're in good form and playing well you want the games to come and you're 100% right we want the games to come thick and fast um but of course we have to do those games Justice and perform the way that we have done so much has been said about the Midfield three and you know finally kind of hitting gold but are you going to have to really manage the whole team with with the volume of games yeah what we've decided to do is look at it a game by- game basis so last week was a three- game week um because of the score line in a couple of games we were able to just ease um players minutes uh and manage the squad within the game so then we felt the players were fresh enough to go again so we'll we'll do the same we'll continue to do it on a game by- game basis rather than making decisions beforehand on who we're going to rest and a word about Miley how do you think he's responding to kind of getting back getting involved with the first team it's it's been a long road for him and you know someone that's had an unbelievable Journey over the last couple of years yeah he has um I think he's handling himself really well um he's training well behind the scenes I think we've tried to be really careful with him and make sure there's been no reoccurrence of his injury um for someone so young and the demands that he faced last year physical demands um we feel this year we needed to manage that and respect that and to make sure we give him the best chance of staying fit and look after him at such an early age of his career early stage of his career but he's looking good now and I'd say physically he's looking stronger than last year naturally he's he's worked hard in the gym um his body's turning into a man's body and uh I'm really pleased with his progress he I mean he couldn't have a much better Midfield to kind of learn from do you see the more senior players kind of taking him under their wing as such um I wouldn't say necessarily taking him under their wing I think Louie himself is very mature for his age I think he's treated as a player an individual player now like a proper player no one's had to take him under the wing because of how he's handled himself he's not needed that sort of that reassuring presence above him he's very individual very strong willed um so no but I think there's a lot of respect there internally in our Midfield you look at the players and the qualities that the six midfielders we have at the moment um Bring It's a healthy competition so I think they'll as much as they they'll look at Louie and think we want to help him and look after him they know that he's snapping at their Hills also to take their place and just finally um you asked about Christmas traditions at home but what about here at the club how have you been celebrating Christmas here have you done a secret Santa or anything no we've tried to stay away from that I think uh for obvious reasons uh we've had a Christmas dinner we've had um a couple of club events which have been really good um I know the players have been out and about um not not obviously before games but visiting s to various occasions um because I think the club have done a really good job in trying to look after the players families and making sure everyone enjoys the festive Spirit while not getting um distracted thank you thanks Nisha Damian morning Eddie morning um just going back to Alex as a young player he scored goals but not necessarily prolifically what did you see in him that made you think he could score goals in the Premier League I think L at this game in depth as we as I do with every signing because have to have a a vision of where they're going to fit into the team and how they're going to enhance our style of play I think with Alex his all round game I felt was really strong so he could do a little bit of everything as you've seen him do for us dropping deep to to link play and being a creative link between our Midfield and our attack but also bring those standout qualities individually where he can make something happen out of nothing um I believed he had from that one season where he scored a huge amount of goals in La Liga at such a young age isn't easy to do um that I felt he had the goal scoring prowess to deliver that into the Premier League albeit there's always a slight question mark because until you see it delivered in the Premier League with the physicality of this league you never quite know how it transfers and that's where I have to give him a huge compliment because I think he's made that step from um the various leagues that he's been in to come to the Premier League I think he's done really well and he's almost taken everything in his stride in some senses has he surprised you how quickly he's taken to this this league and this this type of football I don't think he surprised me because I think I I really believed we wouldn't have committed the fee that we did um to the transfer if he didn't believe that he could play and do well straight away I think that for that sum of money I don't think you're looking at a development player you're looking at a play that you feel can come in straight away and and hit the ground running now he's done that but he deserves a lot of credit for it because it's not an easy thing to do to transfer leagues in the way that he has um and I just hope it's a start for him he's had a brilliant couple of seasons for us and he looks like he's hitting his best Rhythm now he's such a valuable player for us um I think all the players look to him um to to help us in the creative side of the game and he's delivering at the moment thank you got to Lee Dom and then Chris there's one story coming from Saudi Arabia this morning a deal being agreed for to braa just wonder if you could respond to that yeah that's news to me I mean um I've been aware of the rumors and the um talk about that um that deal but uh I don't think it's got to that point and just on the sort of the transfers looking at it obviously we've been told there's no pot of money to spend and obviously you don't want to sell your best players so how after two windows can you move things along and try and freshen up even a little bit um that's a good question I don't know the answer to that one to be honest I I don't know if freshening up the squad is something that we would necessarily look to do because I think in the window that we have coming up with the the situation that we are in at the moment um freshening up is a dangerous word because what does that mean I think any player that we bring into the football club's got to have value it's got to have value short term or long term um and of course we don't want to destabilize the squad by losing players either so um it could be a case that we we do nothing this January and um yeah we move on to the summer just on Jamal lels we haven't heard a lot from from his comeback he was in the stands watching the reserves the other night so he's obviously still very focused yeah he's very focused he's um we always said he's a bit behind Sven Sven um had no complications at all in his rehab and um as much as it was they're always difficult injuries the longterm knee injuries are always very difficult and you have your ups and downs Sven was pretty standard Jamal's had a couple of I wouldn't say setbacks but a couple of moments where his knee's not felt as strong um and he would just take a little bit long longer than than svend did but he's on track and he's he's doing well he I got to say his dedication you know sometimes he's been here to five six o'clock at night and that's on a regular basis that's the dedication that he's giving to his comeback and I'm sure he reap the rewards from that thanks day D morning Eddie morning Sven botman sticking on that subject played 60 Minutes last week for the 21s you've mentioned practice games for him just how close is he to being back involved in the match day Squad and could we see him on boxing day yeah he's getting closer um pleased with how he's been in the last couple of weeks so he's had various tests whether that's in training or from the games that you mentioned so came through another practice match um at the weekend on Saturday did well looking good so yeah it'll be a case of deciding when we reintroduce him to the squad Dan bur's a player you've regularly praised this season he's been very consistent performer how do you go about reintroducing Sven back into the starting lineup that's always the the question isn't it um I think without a doubt we need a player of friends quality um in the squad so it be we're welcome him back with open arms but of course the challenge for Sven is to earn his place back it's certainly not going to be given and that would be the same for anybody I think when you've had such a a long-term injury there will be a period where Sven will have to work back to his best level that's the same for everybody um but it's great to have competition for places that's what we've missed next up Chris more you just following up on the report about Mar Deka I mean is that a an ex that you could sanction at the moment given Nick pp's injury or is that something you wouldn't consider while Nick pp's out injured well certainly we wouldn't want to lose the goalkeeper that's playing for us currently uh that wouldn't make sense so know that isn't a deal that we would um want to sanction currently and if and when Nick comes back and it was something you would consider could you bring in another goalkeeper or would it be case if do you have the capacity to do that if you were to lose someone well these are questions that we have to um find answers to um as I say the Martin situation uh isn't clearcut let's let's wait and see what happens in the next few weeks but he's certainly doing very well I've been really pleased with his reintroduction into the team I think he's given us a calmness a composure he's made a couple of really good saves let's not forget the one he made at 1 nil against dip switch was a big moment in the game so delighted with how he's playing and um yeah he's in goal for us at the moment and doing a great job thanks Chris we've got the Craig uh Jordan I'm K morning Eddie a subject we've explored a lot in the last few weeks is where the club is currently at you know in The Wider context of a PSR world and you expressed that very eloquently seven days ago by extension and this isn't specific to one player in particular how do you keep those top Stars at the club when by an admission the journey has been slowed because of some external factors how do you keep them happy and how do you keep them here well I think um the challenge for the team is to be successful so I think a successful team everything's easier uh across the board in every respect so the challenge for me is to try and push the team to those Heights now we're in the semi-final of the cup competition that's a massive thing for everybody on the horizon that brings real positivity our league forms improving um if we can continue to improve I think we put ourselves in a a good position so I think everything's linked to that really um now of course away from the football we have a duty to look after the players to treat them well to give the environment that they really enjoy um and of course then there's other stuff behind that in terms of their contracts so it's a multi-link thing but I think on the pitch is the most important this is a similar sort of subject and it was a story this morning that might make you smile but Bournemouth are in line to qualify for the Champions League given their currently fifth in the Premier League and the coefficient has fifth that's having the Premier League getting an extra place next year is that an incentive for you guys is that something you look at given your are only two points off fifth now and one of the answers to the question of asked is probably well if you're in the Champions League that takes that box for a lot of players is that something you're looking at that fifth place yeah that's linked to the answer that I just gave you I think success on the pitch is everything um we we said last year we want European football in any respect but of course the champions league is the the one that everyone uh wants more than anything else so uh we will give our best to have the best season that we can I don't see any reason why we can't be very successful this year yes you need a little bit of luck and sense of injuries and keeping the squad together um in that respect but team looks really good at the moment I think the balance is strong so we just want the games to come and to try and win as many as we can thanks Craig Jordan War just another one on leis Miley has he returned a better player this season I know it's probably difficult to make that judgment because hasn't played as many minutes as you would like but Bas what you've seen in TR has he is he better than the player he was last season as you say it's a difficult one to answer but I don't see any reason why he wouldn't be I mean he's definitely physically in a much better place than he was and that's just through development of his muscles and his body as he gets into that transition phase from as I say 17 to 18 it's a a big age for any young man um I think technically tactically I think he will naturally improve because he just becoming a little bit more wiser and Street wise about the game but he's still got the same qualities I've seen that in training his passing range his calmness on the ball um decision making for such a young player really sets him apart so I'd love to think of be in a really good place now of course he'll need games to find his rhythm um that's going to be difficult to guarantee him at the moment with the strength of our Midfield but certainly he's going to play a part in um the shortterm and the long-term future for us he's such an important player and just one on on Tino as well how much has he developed this season because obviously you've got KY and trip fit there but it's probably credit to Tino that he's be able to keep keing out with the team yeah I thought Tino the last few games is really um really played well uh very very pleased especially Ipswich I thought he his technical delivery was a really high level I thought we very good down the right hand side with him and Jacob in tandem together I always think relationships in the team are so important you go back to a couple of years ago the relationship between Kieran Miggy Jacob sha was so strong down the right hand side for us and I think then when you through injury we've had to um find a couple new Solutions down that side it takes a little bit of time to build those relationships but I think we've seen in recent weeks a really strong uh Partnerships emerging um really pleased with Tino's development physically he's looked really really good as well so very happy with him thanks John morning we've seen for so long the same teams finishing in the top four and the top six new castle and astonvilla have disrupted that do you feel there forces at play that maybe don't want to see that happen again so say that last um do you feel there are forces at Bay that want to stop that happening again obviously with the rules and what have you um I'm sure um there's people that don't want that to happen again but I think the beauty of the Premier League this year is you never quite know what's going to happen you've seen as we said earlier teams find it difficult to string consistent runs of results together and as I say not just us we've seen Notting Forest Bournemouth Lo loads of teams have really really strong Seasons the level of the Premier League and we've said well I've said this consistently has been really tight this year between all teams I don't think there's a lot of difference between the top and the bottom sides and that's Testament and quality of every team in the league and there's no easy games um I think that makes a great uh spectacle I think it makes it a great League because you never know what's going to happen you never know what twist turns are ahead and I think it's up for all of us to try and yeah break into whatever group of teams try and upset people and uh achieve success so you don't see it as a closed shop I never see anything as a closed shop I think it's our job to just try and achieve the most that we can put no barriers on our levels or our expectations of ourselves internally and see what happens okay concludes this part of the press conference we'll move it on for boxing days papers this is embargo till 10:30 p.m. on Christmas night we'll start with Damian I just on Sandra obviously his first year or so he was very difficult for obvious reasons but now he's in the team and playing really well how have you seen him grow on an off the pitch um I think the the best qualities of Sandro is that he doesn't as I've said many times he doesn't really give too much away so even in this spell where he is playing superbly well I've been really really happy with how he's looked in the team I'd still say he's the same Sandro that he was last year when he couldn't play and he was banned in terms of his General conduct and feeling around the training ground is the same and I think that's what I'm trying to say is that's a quality that last year he brought to us you know he was very uh low maintenance you know a player that you can't use in games but you can only train a uh was incredibly helpful to the players that were playing incredibly supportive of them um and yeah he's carried that on this year where now he's obviously available and playing very well but those qualities still exist he's still a very good teammate he's still you know caring about the other players um can't speak highly enough of how he's conducted himself Craig and then Lee yeah sticking with Sandro as well Eddie know one of the comparisons drawn is Andrea peo Andrea peo didn't actually become the player we know until he's late 20s Sandro now was slotting into that six row and looks like the conductor can you just talk about that comparison do you see that likeness and just Sandro playing that role where he's he's orchestrating everything right now yeah I definitely when I first saw Sandro play there was definite links to poo without a doubt and it's not just the hair you know there's more to it than that but he's uh he's definitely got those those similar qualities in terms of build and and style but I think the thing that set Sandra apart for me from anyone else was he could do all of those things technically and tactically look really good but his his athleticism as well his ability to run I think we've seen that in recent games from a defensive Viewpoint now more than an attacking Viewpoint where he's breaking to you know as in sprinting to put out fires for us from a defensive viewpoint nicking balls intercepting balls using athleticism to track runners I think he's been excellent in that respect and I think that's really helped the team so yes I think there is the obvious ones in terms of his technique and his passing and and everything else but I think that's the thing that sets him apart he just done Kieran trip here last January he had an opportunity to to go Bayern Munich um he's now on the bench for Newcastle I mean how do you how do you keep I know he's a big professional but how how do you keep him motivated because surely he may look back at that and think that was a big chance for us to go and play with Harry Kane over in Germany yeah I don't think anything's as clear-cut as that I think he's a very very valuable member of the squad really highly respected by all of us and he's an outstanding player now yeah he's just worked his way back from a couple of injuries that he's had um and he's still I would say still working his way back to his absolute best fitness levels I'd say he's fit enough to play no doubt about that but he's um still working his way back because he just hasn't had the football to sort of underline those physical qualities but there's no doubting and when he's come on the pitch in the last few games I think he's technical quality has been very high as always and that's what sets him apart he's a very rare fullback there's not many like him that can assist and create in the way that he does with both crosses and with long range passing so he he's incredibly respected by us and wanted by us so I have no doubt that um he could easily get back into the team and have a you know a long run in the team and um that's how good he is so um I don't see it quite like the question and on Bruno um he feels the last two or three games he really is grown into that that role now he's really learning the role just going along yeah I think there'd be an element of that where it is very very different for him I think as the deeper player you're receiving the ball usually um well sometimes with your back to goal but majority of time you might be side on and facing the opponent's goal but definitely higher up it changes dimensions of the pitch change how you receive the ball changes the expectations on you change physically it's a much B uh bigger physical demand but I think he's responded really well to it highlighted probably by his assist where he's you know really high up the pitch winning the ball back and assisting Alex with the a really good press I think he's done that part of the game really well so very pleased with his attitude and to the change you have to get the player to buy in and um he's been absolutely first class with that okay thank you everybody have a lovely Christmas thank you yeah Merry Christmas everyone have a good one
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,KiK-PsO_4Mg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiK-PsO_4Mg,good morning Eddie firstly can we get your reaction please to the draw for the semi-finals of The League Cup You'll Play Arsenal yeah I think we were guaranteed a tough game whoever we got um I watched it with interest last night I thought the the game beforehand was an unbelievable game to watch so I think whenever you get to this stage of the competition you know the the quality of the teams is very high and yeah we play Arsenal and I think we've had some good games against them in the last couple of years so we look forward to to that still a few weeks until you play the first leg and then the the second leg is a month later but that second leg to be at St James's Park um if you could have chosen you probably would have it that way wouldn't you to be at home second I think you probably would yeah I I don't think there's a a whole lot in it but I think um that probably would have been our preference but I think any game against Arsenal is difficult home or away but as I said we've had some really good competitive games I think they've been really tight um so I think that's something on the horizon for us to really look forward to I think we're all excited by that those two games uh quite unique that they're separated so far apart but they're they're sort of now in the background of my mind the focus very very quickly as I said after the game against brenford is on ipswitch um and we've prepared the game and we're looking forward to it Joe Lon is suspended this weekend but he was substituted the other night um after picking up a a couple of facial injuries or wounds can you tell us how he is um has he recovered from that yeah he's okay he's a little bit battered and bruised yesterday had a a few stitches I believe sort of in his ear or around the area of the year which was quite delicate um so yeah he had a cut mouth so I think uh probably with him not being available this weekend is probably a good thing for him because it allows him to rest those bruises and wounds and then hopefully be fully fit for the week off it's been a good week for you hasn't it at home seven goals two victories you'd be looking to take that into IP switch this weekend do you feel like momentum could be building now and and you starting to put a run together which is something unfortunately you haven't done often enough this season yeah we hope so I think very good feeling around the team at the moment um not just with the two games but I think even brenford was a a blip within that but going back behind those games I think we've actually performed very well so I'd like to think we're building some momentum but proof will be in what we deliver on Saturday we know uh Portman Road ipswitch difficult game really competitive team um I think kieran's done an unbelievable job there and they've been very even the games they've lost this season they've been in all those games very tight matches very competitive team as I say so we're going to have to be hyper alert we're going to have to be ready for the match there two victories in the Premier League IPS which have both both been away from home and you'll have taken teams to Portman road before um obviously they've had some tough matches but maybe with the backing they get it's perhaps a surprise it's taken so long and you'll be wary of that because it would be so meaningful and significant for them to get that first home win this weekend yeah I'm sure from their perspective that's what they're chasing and I think when I've reviewed and looked back at their home games they've been they've been very good there and and that's no surprise I think coming into the Premier League I watched them a lot in the championship last year there that home form was outstanding so you look back at the last League game against Bournemouth where they're leading for so long in the game um and then Bournemouth come back right at the end as they've done a few times this season and take the game it was hard on them but that is the the quality of the Premier League and I'm sure they're they be focused they've had a week to prepare we've had a shorter time but uh back the players to be ready just want to ask you lastly about the schedule over the next few days because you've got to travel you've got the match and then there are more games coming up over the Christmas period what about training though for the players will they get time off over Christmas and Christmas Day possibly no we be in on Christmas day um I think the game takes priority and we have to prepare in the right way so I think the players expect that now I I don't think there's any thought that they're going to get Christmas day off uh so no I think it's an intense schedule for THE PLAYERS don't think there's been any change there I think we've always when you're in this industry you know that the Christmas period is slightly different for us but we enjoy it and I think with the games around Christmas do have a unique atmosphere they have a special feel to them hopefully they'll continue to have a special feel because we get some good results and that's the plan um but a busy period coming up now with the two Cup games sandwiched in between um a busy run of league and cup with the FA Cup coming up so we're looking forward to the games thanks R Andy well n uh confidence has been a a word that's been mentioned quite a lot in these press conferences over the last couple of weeks um after the results of the last week where's it at percentage wise would you say within the team right now if you can even put a percentage on it I've never done it before I'll give it a go for you um I'd say it's building definitely I think we're human beings I think there has been a slight at times in certain games confidence issues but I think you've seen a really good feeling within the team in the last two performances and as I say i' probably say three out of the last four have been really really strong as strong as we've seen this season hopefully that's a good sign uh I think we're scoring goals again which is such a confidence Builder three goals again the other night and possibly could have scored more goals from different areas of the pitch which we haven't had this season really we've always had that historically goals from everywhere I think it's a really important aspect and it was great to see Sandro um pop up with two massive goals for us because I think if you believe you can score goals from a number of sources areas of the team uh that naturally lifts how you feel about yourself yeah I was I was on the Metro come back from brenford game and as ever there's a few fans analyzing it and saying what they liked about the performance and naturally the mood typ so I thought I'd ask you what's kind of pleased you most in the last two performs I imagine it is the fact that Newcastle are back amongst the goals again yeah I think always a combination of things because you need to be solid defensively I think up until the last 10 minutes against brenford we were really solid thought we looked offensively secure last 10 minutes wasn't great uh but yeah I think we've had a number of shots in the last few games we went through a couple of games where it was well documented we weren't creative enough so to see our attacking players look like they're enjoying themselves and playing with freedom playing with that you need to play within a structure but you need to give the players obviously freedom to express themselves and they look like they've got that balance right at the moment and they're high quality players I've got no doubt um if we can get the ball to our attacking players in the right positions they can create for us you mentioned Sandra tanali there um I think it was his second goal the celebration he he was kind of surrounded by the other players and I've never seen it before where the players the whole team surround him and start kind of singing his Terrace chants in the manner that they did have you ever seen that before as a manager most importantly what does that say about in what high esteem Sandro is held amongst his teammates I wasn't aware of what they were doing to be honest I haven't seen that so I don't know unless you're in that celebration I'm not sure you can actually guarantee what they're doing um but I think anything that that makes the player in that moment feel special and important is is a great thing and I think you can see I often say to the players you can tell a lot from a celebration of a goal can tell a lot by the harmony of the group The Spirit of the group I love to see the players celebrate together I love to see the whole team together and share that moment with whoever scores or whoever assists um because I think you need that feeling connection between the players you you need to have that feeling that whoever scored or taking the Acclaim in that moment you're doing it together and you're trying to lift each other higher I think that's such an important part of a team's identity we talk about if switch and we talk about the fact there's been no win at home for them this season but like you said they've been pretty impressive under Kieran McKenna so you know he's a young British manager for yourself as a youngish British manager I suppose how highly would you rate Kier yeah very very high I think had the pleasure of meeting him a few times over the years and I think he's a first of all he's a really good downto earth guy obviously goes without saying as a top manager you know what he's done coach what what he's done with IP switch is incredible um dramatic steep rise going through the leagues um with near enough the same group of players speaks volumes for his abilities to develop players and get the best out of each and every one of them you they will be a a really tough game for us we um have to be ready for what they're going to bring to us and we have to bring our a game to them just finally you mentioned Joe linon how else are Newcastle looking I imagine after two games this week fatigue is going to be an issue as well in terms of Team selection tomorrow um yeah I think there's some Tide bodies but I think refreshingly energetic because the results have been good and I think that that does change S how you feel about your body um so yeah we'll speak to the players today we'll make assessments on where everyone looks and then try and pick the right team than thanks Andy Nisha morning Eddie after the game um on weddingday Dan Burns spoke about how calm Sandro tanali is how he doesn't get too high he doesn't get too low Wednesday probably the biggest high he's had at the club how do you expect him to respond does he just go back to normal back to training mode how do you think he'll react yeah he I'd say Dan's right in the respect that he doesn't necessarily outwardly show massive changes of emotions um I think that's a real strength for a player because I think it's very easy to to get really um drawn to the contrasting emotions that you can face face as a player it's never always good or always bad and you need to be able to take both um emotions the same way if you possibly can in a controlled way I think that's the best way for consistent success so I said many times during Sandro's vanan you know he was the same every day training well very supportive of his teammates there wasn't any massive outward show of emotion and he's the same when he plays the other night he was the same when he came in he's sort of humble guy wants to do a good job for the team and wants to help the team in any way that he can but I know secretly not secretly but within himself he' be very happy that um he contributed with the goals um and he's playing very well do you think he's been aware of the noise that's surrounded him because of what he's been through because of what he's achieving now there's been obviously in the media followed the story but fans as well very invested in him do you think he's been aware of that I don't know I think it's difficult to give a clear answer on that because I think every player's different and what they surround themselves with social media I've got no idea who's sort of active on social media who's not who absorbs information and who doesn't um but I do think Sandro will know the depth of love he has from the Newcastle supporters and everyone internally at the club I I don't think you can go into a game and not be aware of that especially on Match Day with the the chance that he has for his names the flags that he's seen so I'm sure he'd be very very aware that everyone absolutely loves him and is delighted to see him playing at his best level we're getting close to January I know you love the January transfer window questions but absolutely how how do you feel with the plan that the club has going forward to January do you think you're in a good place um yeah it's been very very loose discussions isn't there hasn't been um uh many discussions in great depth on January and that's because we're we' got a lot of games our focus is on on the matches and we're restricted to a degree on what we can and can't do so I don't think that's our main focus at the moment certainly not mine anyway um but of course aware January is coming around the corner and we'll need to be reactive um and ready to um do certain things I'm sure and just finally from um you met a Newcastle fan Steven Hunter who has a terminal illness but was over the moon to meet you and to tell you to play Tar you'll have lots of interactions with fans and I mean this one was very special what impact does that have on you a huge impact yeah I think I was delighted to welcome him to the press conference and to give him that experience then to meet him afterwards for the first time was it's an inspiring moment for me because you see someone in um such high High Spirit so passionate about the football club obviously the football club is important for him at a really difficult time in his life um so to be able to give him that um Escape um and to bring him closer to one of his big passions in his life was an amazing thing to be able to do and then to for him to tell me to play Tali which I did and then for Sandro to score the two goals and win us the game was a great moment and it was nice to find him in the crowd and just share a quick moment at the end of the game thank you thanks Lee Ryder and we'll go to Gary at the back morning Eddie um Mig Alon his sort of situation I know he hasn't had much game time the season and there's been a lot of talk that he could go could you just give us a sort of flavor of where he is in the yeah mig's still absolutely Miggy in every way and I mean that is an absolute compliment Smiley happy focused professional unbelievable guy migy and just I can't praise His professionalism enough this season and which been a difficult season for him because he hasn't had the minutes that he would have wanted but he's never let that um showing his everything that he's delivered for us and I know he's ready to play if needed and I think again the other night when he came on I thought he showed his qualities never doubt never doubted his qualities for a second yes there's been a lot of speculation now over mig's future for a while and I think all I'd ever say to any player that's contracted here and and absolutely love like Miggy is my only focus is on Miggy being here um and showing him the respect that he's deserved for his contribution to Newcastle and obviously you can't mention names but there there's been sort of a lot of transfer stories in the word closing in and Newcastle are very close to to doing a deal is that something that surprises you when you hear that on an incoming you mean yeah uh yeah it well it does because that's not the reality so no we're not close to sealing any transfer or closing in on any player for me as I said earlier that the discussions on January have been very loose because we know we're in a position where um we're restricted to what we can and can't do so for me the focus is purely on the moment of coaching on sorry on coaching the team this game it's got kind of the same sort of build up to it to the Loon game last year just before Christmas which obviously didn't go well and ipswitch will be desperate to welcome a big team like Newcastle coming down how do you sort of get the mentality R for this game and avoid what happened at Luton last Christmas yeah that's interesting you bring that up because we were looking back to last year and discussing certain games around this period it's actually a difficult moment for us this time last year [Music] um I don't know I think you can build it up too much in respect of uh the mentality for the players the mentality for the players should be the same every game regardless of our opponent we just need our players to play I think with with freedom with expression of course they need to approach the game in the right way that goes without saying and if you don't at any any opponent you can be beaten but I think the lads are in a good moment we want to try and roll that into the next game and for us to be at our best thanks Lee Gary hi just going back to Sandra obviously got two goals the is it for Midfield to we know Alexander just take that scaring burden of especially withum being injured yeah it's really important I think when you look at our Midfield I mean not necessarily the expectation on the six to be honest for goals but more from the eights the eights are consistently in the Box they have to create and try and score goals so there's a bigger bonus on them really to produce goals and assists and it's been a um an area where we haven't been at our fluent best I think this season in terms of those numbers so it's great to see a midfielder contribute I mean Sandro scored two one from a set play one from a longrange strike and they're like so important for us th those moments those goals because they're they're almost bonus goals that's how I view it um but we need those players contributing it was good to see again albeit from a sort of a second phase set play Bruno get an assist and a goal from a center half as well in Fabby because he's popped up with two important contributions so goals from everywhere is what we encourage he's kind of already touched on me next it's not only the Midfield goal for him he's on four I think he's third top scer for you this season I remember hearing an interview years both with Neil Warner he said he set a Target every year he wanted his Center ARS to be getting at least six seven goals the season Tak mindset so do you have any Targets similar to that that you can share with us yeah I remember one year I scored five and the next the next season I set a Target at 10 and I think I got one so uh maybe Target setting isn't the uh the best the best idea I think I know the center halves take that side of their game really seriously I Know Dan Dan's obviously a huge huge present for us in both boxes and I know he wants to score more um and they regularly work on different aspects of their game in terms of goal scoring the center backs because set plays are so important and we've done well in that respect in recent weeks um but I don't know whether focusing too much on that Target is is a wise thing as I said it's more I think the practice and repetition and I think if you can get that right they will score goals just last one me SP after the game the other night and he looked back to two years ofo and obviously still got the semi-final to get but he just touch on I maybe they got caught in the emotion of that whole thing two years ago um how do you stop the players from getting involv getting too involved it's an emotional Club isn't it you know the F very emotional how do you stop the players from I think it's difficult for me to stop the players because I think as you say it's a very emotional club and and I mean that for the positive not for for the negative I think I don't know how you can blank certain things out the players will experience building up to a big game and almost in some senses I think when you're here for a period of time I think you get used to that and you you understand it a bit more I think we were emotional going into the semi-finals and even the quarterfinal that year was a highly emotional game but it it served us well the final was the final we didn't quite get a few things right on the day um but hopefully we can learn from that but I think any Talk of the final is a long long way off two two games against Arsenal to uh to focus on thanks car got to Rebecca Jordan and then Dominic morning Eddie morning um talked before about how IPS s are really competitive do you think they've been unfortunate not to get more points this season and where do you kind of assess their biggest threats for tomorrow's game yeah I think definitely you'd say they've been very unfortunate in certain games not to not to have picked up more points um but it swings and roundabouts I think they picked up a a great win last week against wolves in the last seconds of the game so these things do tend to even themselves out one thing I will say they've got unbelievable Spirit you can see that within the group um I Never Say Die attitude so that they're great qualities to possess and we know going into the game that we've got to match all the the intensity and the desire that they will bring to the game their bigger strengths I think without a doubt they've got some very good attacking players um they missed the lap through suspension he's done very well for them this season but with Hutchinson schox um they've got some really really good attackers that we've played against before and we're very aware of um Leaf Davis is a real attacking threat from left back with his assist record last year which was incredible so um we're well aware of their threats and as well on Wednesday willla came on uh towards the end made a a brief appearance just how important is it for him to get minutes in the senior side but also experience those kind of Big Cup competitions and games as well yeah it's been really nice to be able to bring him on in recent weeks um he yes of course he needs minutes um to develop around the training that he's doing he's working incredibly hard in his training as well so um I thought of some really bright spots in his game uh a chance late on really good pace and strength to run in behind so hopefully we can continue to get him on the pitch thank you Jordan morning just on January what what would it take for Newcastle actually go and sign a player what what would you have to do cuz it team's quite a a complex window in many cases financial situation and it being JRE in general yeah but I think everything's got to align I think there's got to be um a lot of things that come together for us to to do that I've said many many times it's not through the the lack of Desire or want from me and everyone connected with the club to do that but it's got to be right and it's got to be right not just for the here and now but for the future as well so we got to be responsible um to make sure that any decision we make doesn't affect us in future Windows as well and Le touched upon the speculation around in players and Mort de braa now there's been a lot of noises from from Saudi Arabia potentially him going there what is the situation of him because he is out of contract at the end of the season as well yeah I'd say with the same with with everyone that's being linked with moves it's not something that of course that I want to see um or to read about or for the players to read about everyone that is contracted to us is our player and I want their focus to be on playing well for us for as long as they're here and that would be the same for anyone anyone who's even not linked with moves um we have so many big games to come we need everyone focused on what they're doing in the here and now and you said after the game on Wednesday you wouldn't want to lose anyone in January but is there a possibility that someone could go there's always a possibility I never say here sit here now and say well no one will leave um but it's got to be be um in conjunction with what we need from the team's perspective and again always battling and balancing the the long-term uh future of the club so um hopefully we won't lose anybody that we don't want to lose thanks joh Dominic and then Karen morning Eddie just on the subject of contracts you've got Fabian Sher Shan long staff both recently made 200 appearances for the club understood to be out of contract at the end of the season is there is that still the case and is there any update on their situ ations um I think well we we'll give you news on those things as and when um things happen I think we've got important players that are out of contract that we want to try and um tie down to new contracts but yeah we'll give you the news when we when we have it yeah and in terms of contracts transfers you have to act in the best interest of the club players will have understandably their own agendas you spoke about that balance how how difficult is it to find that yeah of course cuz I'm speaking on behalf of the club here and that's our wants but obviously the players have their own wants and needs and you totally respect and understand that because it's a short career players have to be happy in their environment they have to um be absolutely content that we're trying to provide the right things for them in their careers and they're getting their wants and needs satisfied it's always a two-way thing um we've got a really good group of professionals who are you very very um professional and diligent and I can't speak highly enough of of everybody really connected with the club at the moment um but of course we'll always speak with players individually and try and find the right Solutions if they're not happy you spoke about being reactive in January in terms of targets are there any there it's just a case of potentially waiting for a green light we'll always have targets we'll always have things bubbling along in the background um the recruitment team will be doing a lot of work of course in preparation for potential opportunities that arise but I think at the moment that's not sort of the main body of our work thanks kieren morning uh two of Sir Bobby's former clubs in Newcastle nips which facing each other how inspiring is this Legacy for you does that drive you on every day yeah I it's not lost on me the relationship that uh so Bobby Robson had with ipswitch I think sometimes it doing a little bit more digging into the history that he had it can surprise you the length of time that he served there as manager I was um caught a little bit by that um of course he has a a stand named after him there and to have that sort of relationship with two clubs is very unique and it shows what a man and what a manager um he was so yeah I'm aware of that connection and we want to try and do his legacy proud at the weekend and you often use the phrase right player when it comes to transfers what would that look like in January well the right player obviously is the right position the the right cost um so much goes into it you could reel off 20 20 things that make the right player But ultimately if you're not necessarily actively in the market the right player almost becomes redundant because it's as I said many times it's what we can do not what we want to do thanks K Simon hi Eddie um building a a team that works is often about relationships and chemistry routin players um that seem to be improving between Bruno and tanali how has that happened do they get on and are they mates off the pitch and how are they working together as as far as you're concerned yeah they've always been friends off the pitch I think from very early on I think Bruno and Sandra hit a hit a connection together but it's not just about those two players I know why people do focus on them but it's not about just those two players to create a Midfield Dynamic that works we have we play with three midfielders the majority of the time so there is a third one in there that has to has to work as well um I think it's something that will'll never stop having to to try and find solutions to from my side whether it's Sandro Bruno whether it's other areas of the team you're always looking at who plays better with certain players and trying to find the right chemistry sometimes the chemistry you can't really describe but it just happens and I think it's happened or happening on the pitch between our Midfield I think it's looked really good in recent weeks there's a lot of rotation and a lot of it's not as just simple as one player and playing one position and one player playing the other um and sometimes that can only come from playing games together that relationship building comes from the matches of course we didn't have Sandro for so long in that respect um it was very difficult to I think form those relationships in just training alone
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,WTU4HW-ZOyw,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTU4HW-ZOyw,hi Eddie uh Sven botman played for the under 21s last night came through an hour how is he was he all right no effects well I don't know how he is this morning it's quite early um but he was good last night we exchanged messages after the game um seemed in a really good place I that's always a big step you you play the first game um he looked good on the pitch I thought his movement was good typical Sven he used the ball well he looked commanding big presence on the pitch um um yeah he's a massive player for us we've missed him so that's a big step forward but he's still a little bit to go before available for selection so no change in terms of a a time frame or schedule for him regarding being in your first team squad well I think we were looking um right to the end of December beginning of January that's the plan we're still on track with the plan I think with the length of time that he's been out ideally he gets two to three maybe even more games to get his rhythm back because um obviously a big step back into the Premier League have you got any new injury concerns ahead of the cup quarterfinal don't believe so um still have training today of course um so we look forward to that but at the moment I think from Saturday clean bill of health it's an interesting situation with midfielders because Joe Linton got that fifth Premier League yellow card at the weekend but he can play against brenford but I think sha longstaff is suspended isn't he after two cup uh booking so you'll have to do something different in Midfield over the next few days but in terms of Jo Linton it's great to have him available for a big game but just a blow to lose him for ipswitch yeah as you say slightly strange with how the the booking system works now so yes we lose Shawn and then we lose Joe Linton for the the game at the weekend but I think that is a position that we have strength and depth with um Joe Willet coming back to Fitness Louie Miley playing again last night looking good um that's a huge lift for us the Midfield is is looking strong brand you played in the league not so long ago how instructive is it to look back at that match when it comes to thinking about how tomorrow night could go because I don't think the two teams tend to change the way they play both very attacking um yeah I think it is an interesting game to look back on for various things of course um brenford went to Chelsea and played a different system although they don't as you say they don't deviate too far from their principle so um that's an interesting Dynamic for us to consider But ultimately I think when you look back at the game we weren't where we needed to be in the defensive aspects of our game M mainly which was a strange one for us off the back of the Liverpool performance which is very good I know we conceded three goals but in the main very good um but we just weren't there defensively and ultimately that cost us the game so I think um good to see us back to our defensive best against Leicester where we restricted them to very few opportunities on goal protected our goal really well um I think that's going to be the big the big thing for us I think if we can do that we back ourselves to score goals and with it being such a big match in a competition that means a lot to you and your players and potential of another semi-final ahead of you if you can get the job done how important is it that this tie is at St james' park in front of a full house yeah well when the draw came out I think that was what um gave us a great feeling the fact that we know we have such a powerful um um Force at home with our supporters um as long as we create that positivity with our performance which we did against Leicester thought the supporters were really good with us um and yeah I think when you play these games the cup games the one-off games and an opportunity for a semi final we hope that that's um something that can lean the game in our favor but it's going to come down to us executing our plan well and contining where we left off with a good good feeling against Leicester thanks Rosen Keith hi Eddie hi um when you look at this season so far it feels a bit like you take one step forward and then maybe two steps don't say it how important is it that you go into this game tomorrow and you you back up what you did on on on Saturday against Leicester yeah I can't disagree with you Keith I mean I think that's been a frustration for all of us and we don't want to take those two steps back we want to keep moving forward I think we'd love to see Leicester as a turning point in our season in terms of that um ability to put a run together I think the feeling was really good against Leicester in a sense that I think the dynamic of the team looked really good the the Partnerships the relationships within the team was strong was a really good attacking performance 27 I think shots at goal high XG but one of those games where you think you well we looked we looked a top team and now a few days later we want to just see that same team in in um evidence again and yeah commit to what is an important competition we know the importance of this game that's not lost on any of us um but we want to see that consistency in our performance and when you when you think back a couple of years to that that cup run to the the final I know obviously it didn't end the way you you wanted but what what's your sort of overriding feeling when you when you look back then because it felt like in the buildup to like that just the whole city kind of all came together as one yeah I remember some tough early rounds uh I think the trir game was difficult Palace game was difficult then of course I think the abiding memor is the semi-finals against Southampton which were both Home and Away Great occasions and you you had that feeling that we were on the verge of going to a really exciting phase of the competition um we're now on the the part where before we get to that semi-final where it feels a lot closer and these games are difficult these these games are especially you know whenever you play brenford it's a difficult game home or away um tough team to play against set plays will be really important for us again um because they're very good in that respect we're very good in that respect as well so that'll be an interesting Dynamic to the game but I think it's the attitude ultimately we have to show how much the game means to us and you're in this game I guess like all other footballers and football managers because you you want to win silver where it's been such a long time for this football club 69 years I there's a couple of rounds to go to even get there but what would it mean for you whether it's now or in the future to bring silverware back to this football club well you're right and the respect that that is what we're here for that's what I made it very clear when I came to Newcastle what I wanted to achieve and I know I speak on behalf of the players and all the coaching staff in that respect so when you get to this part of the competition um I think it's important that we recognize that's our goal and what we're trying to do it's not easy to do as you as everyone knows um but these games take huge importance when you get to the latter stages D hi Edie hi um confidence it's all about confidence isn't it which presumably the Leicester game will have injected a lot of into the team and you know when teams don't have it we've seen that most lately with with Man City you can see what happens how critical was that result against Leicester in terms of approaching this game yeah I agree I think it confidence is huge for any team us included I think you could see the attacking players start to feel really good the moment we go two to 3 n in front and there was a that extra bit of quality and time that confidence gives you they had to have a an extra touch or an extra pause before you make your your next decision um I think we've been on the verge of producing those kind of displays for a while but we haven't for whatever reason either got the first goal or the second goal to really consolidate some really good performances and now you hope that we can be a bit looser in our play um which is so important from an attacking sense you have that freedom and that ability to create and take chances in the final third um hopefully that can you know we can gain that from the Leicester match um and on a similar theme you know the psychology of footballers is so fascinating and we've talked this season about how Newcastle played so well against some of the top teams and yet not so well against some of the the lower um teams in the division that changed against Lester can you put your finger on what that is what that change in Psychology is or what makes that change in Psychology no you're right again that psychology is I wouldn't say underestimated I don't think anyone underestimates really the power of the brain and the power of your thoughts the power of the feeling of the team um but to to fully understand it that's not easy um so I can't give you a one answer that's why we haven't performed as well in certain games than others um I think that there's always four or five things that go into that not just one point and a lot of the time it is even in the games it's moments it's fine margins between scoring not scoring and then the game being totally different I think we felt that against West Ham against Brighton games that could have gone a totally different way if the ball had bounced a slightly different way and that not putting it down to luck that's just the reality I felt those games were very much ours if things had fallen differently for us thanks we'll start with George and then to Luke morning Eddie obviously it's a huge game in its own right semi-finals don't come up around very often but how important is it as a game as a tone Setter as well to show and demonstrate progress both to supporters but also to your own players yeah I think for for everyone internally it's important that we feel that we're we're improving and we're gaining momentum in our season I I do feel we we can still grab the season and have a very successful season um but games like this become pivotal to that I think um that positive energy that we created against L do you want to sustain and you want to harvest and I think then we can achieve great things um but likewise the opposite can happen if um we don't have the right attitude to this game so it's absolutely fundamental we set that and we've tried to set that in the last few days thanks George Luke and then Ian I've done some research this will be the 134th attempt by a Newcastle team to win a domestic cup since they last won the FA Cup how does that make you feel when you hear that sort of number must have been a late night for you just ask um how does that make me feel yeah that's a I know how long it is in terms of years that you've put it a slightly different way a different context but I think I think the willingness has been there from previous teams we want to be the team that can get over the line and Achieve something special but the the as you go through the competition these rounds are very difficult and nothing will be taken from granted from our side but we know if we can hit the the correct level of performance as we did against Leicester then I think we're a match for for anyone in the division if you can get to the semi-final again just trying to put in the context of the club's history which I know you were fully aware of when you come you'd be the first Newcastle manager to get to two domestic Cup competitions in Stan Seymour the first Newcastle manager to get to two semi-finals uh in any competition to Bobby Robson so it shows you how important this is in the wider context of the of the football club yeah and also shows how hard you've been working last night another for a change fantastic delivery of a question I might say um yeah I mean I don't tend to waste time sort of looking back in terms of what we've done historically in in that sense and trying to answer your question it's always about the futur is about just trying to do the best that we can in the here and now um but I think the responsibility of trying to achieve and win competitions and to elevate the club to where it should be in my opinion um is a responsibility we take seriously at all times thank you no pressure here morning Eddie you talking early about momentum which is something every man just strives for from his team do you feel that particularly at St James's part you've got it because you mentioned the Leicester game but your previous game before that was Liverpool which was a similarly excellent performance do you go into this game now with that not that feeling of in invincibility but that feeling of momentum St James yeah I I feel we do I think those two games have been really really good performances arguably I feel we should have won both of those games um the problem for us was brenford was sandwiched in between it and that was a performance where we we didn't like ourselves so um but in in terms of our home performances when you look back to the previous games before the Liverpool game I felt they were sort of promising performances but without delivering the the actions that we needed to to to fully be ourselves um but it was good to see us return the last three games scoring a lot of goals creating a lot of chances that's much more like ourselves um and we back ourselves from an attacking sense with the players that we have always I think the key is to try and be um resilient defensively and it's great to see us keep a clean sheet in our last match and the the cowbo cup a lot of big big teams are still involved it so really reaching semi-final a lot be an achievement in itself it's offering no guarantee is it bearing in mind who's still there there's never any guarantees um but you have to be there to have a chance of winning it so I don't think we should worry about the semi-final in any way or who's left in the competition our only focus should be on brenford and trying to win this match thank you Lee then Jordan and then Joel Morning the car Cup Final in 2023 how it was obviously painful at the time but how useful can that experience now be to try spur you on to get there again yeah I think the final itself can be useful if we get back to a final again I I think that will be really useful for us because I there's a lot of experience gained a lot of lessons learned from that one match itself but I I don't think it's useful necessarily In This Moment approaching this match um the previous experiences of the quarterfinal and semi-final before yes I think they were they were really good things to go through um but I just think this this is a match in isolation This Is Us Against brenford and we know their qualities they're a very good team they've had a really good season so far and we're going to need to nullify their strengths but also attack in the same in the same way that we did in the last match Martin Deka coming back in the team the weekend was that quite a common influence an experienced player coming back in was he the right man obviously for the day yeah I thought so I thought Martin played really well um now didn't have a lot to do with his hands which was a good thing for us as a as a defensive unit but I I think he's very calm in possession I thought he gave us a really good um platform to build from from the back I thought he used the ball really well but as you say vastly experienced very levelheaded um I think he could be really pleased with his return to the team just on the win I mean only a few days ago it was it was Doom and Gloom around T side but it's amazing what one win can can do around the place everyone's smiling in here today are you maybe when I don't come in then maybe before I arrive um that's good to see some Smiles in here uh I think we I think it's different for us we always try to remain level now of course we feel I feel the results more than anybody and yes I do take them home with me and I do live the results I think you have to um to a degree but I then I think once the you digest the result you then look forward with positivity it's the only way to act CU you know you have another chance CH to to change the narrative and I think for us we did that against Leicester now we need to make sure that going back to Keith's question we don't step back we step forward again with real positive energy and attack this game thanks Lee Jordan when you consider Lewis Hall's current form is say the best or one of the best La boxs in the country on current form uh yeah I think he's played very well this season I mean I think he has been very consistent which is belide the team really I think he's been a real Shining Light for us in terms of being the same Lewis regardless home or away um and for someone so young that is not easy to do um I think his technical delivery this year has been outstanding in All Phases buildup phase attacking phase I think this this final ball can improve um but it's great to see him with two assists at the weekend uh I think defensively he's been he's been pretty good I think there's areas again for him to improve and develop but I think he's certainly moving in the right direction and I think for someone so young how he's handled himself the maturity shown on an off the pitch he's been really high level in 12 months AG speak M Le using the word patience does the same situation apply at willan how much inspiration can he take from Lewis's Journey over the last 12 months yeah they're very different players um of course but with any young player I think you need a degree of patience um that's not just a player Play That's The Players Representatives family friends Almost that you're on a path of development 16 17 18 19 whatever age you are and even sometimes older where you're trying to get into the team you got to develop your game there's no point standing still and just while I want to play and wait for your opportunity you've got to develop your game so when you come into the team you're able to stay into in the team so we encourage development all the time we work with our players really hard to try and improve them and will would fall into that category where again yesterday worked extremely hard at his game and we hope that that work will bear fruit at some stage in the future thanks Jordan got to Joe then Rebecca and then Craig hi Eddie you mentioned before about the options you got available to you in Midfield where does Lewis Miley sort of fit into that yeah Lewis is an outstanding young player um he's had a a really difficult time with injuries so we've had to nurse him back and I felt the right path was for him to play games so played last night although I'll be a short period because he' be involved with us on Wednesday um to get his rhythm back because I think that's a really underrated thing and a lot of the time players sort of rush that final that final part so I think when Lewis now plays in the first team he will be at a really good level because of the games that he's had but also there's a fierce competition for places in that area look at the starting three that we had on Saturday outstanding players in their own right then you've got Joe Willock and Sean longstaff two vastly experienced players behind those and then Louie and um Louis is going to be an outstanding player for this club for many many years but we need to handle his recovery um back into the team well which I think we have and I'd say now he's getting himself in a position where he's ready to play and does that need for games potentially would it be somewhere else maybe not in Newcastle so when January orb or are you very much wanting to keep him at the club to deel no Louis will stay uh is too important to us thanks joea morning Eddie morning obviously a lot of talk this morning about momentum just how important is that given that we're kind of at the start of a really busy manic Christmas period like the games do come really thick and fast at this point yeah they do and that's where you know December is such an important month for for any football club um but for us this year I think it's a huge period we're going through with this competition with the league games we have to come I think when January turns and we'll have a good idea of what season we're going to have although the league is very very tight and you can see again that the congestion of teams from us sort of upwards is very unlike the Premier League in previous Seasons so we're there with everybody else thinking I'm sure everyone's thinking the same thing you can get two or three wins together you know you could put yourself in a really strong position so that's what we're looking to do and also so just looking at brenford as well as a team how beneficial is it to play them again in such a short space of time I know that it's cup circumstances and it's a little bit different but is it kind of still fresh in everyone's mind and is the kind of a little bit of wanting to kind of write the wrongs from that game as well from the team well I think definitely from our perspective we want to perform much better than we did in that game we know that we fell below the levels especially defensively as I said conceded four goals it was it was a really um off day in terms of just clinical defending especially highlighted really by the third goal we conceded which was the important goal in the game and really disappointing from our perspective because we know brenford are a strong team from set plays we know that they're got good height in the team we know that they've got some dangerous players they transition well as well so I think they've got various threats we need to nullify um and hopefully we do a better job thank you we'll go to Craig then Lis morning Eddy when the uh when the Takeover went through and after you guys lost in the caribo Cup Final a couple of years ago all the talk then was still of winning champions leagues and winning Premier Leagues that was the the stated ambition by those above you has there been a realization now that actually the the ambition for you guys and players in your squad it's more fa cups and caribo cups because of PSR and all of the factors around where you where you currently are yeah I don't think we've necessarily had those conversations I I don't think a sort of a lowering of expectations has happened sort of internally I don't think there's been one moment where we've gone well we can't do this or we can't achieve that and I don't think that's healthy either um I think from my viewpoint I wouldn't necessarily encourage that from a an internal perspective either because your players will soon pick up if you're not ambitious or you you think something's not possible and I always like to think the impossible is possible especially with my players I I push them to believe that we can achieve anything in saying that with my answer then but there has to be some kind of realistic expectation I think externally because the external pressure will harm us internally that makes sense so I think the external view from media and everyone alike I think needs to be sort of molded around our reality and our reality has been obviously very different in the the last two transfer windows will you pick a team tomorrow night as if it was a cup final because traditionally the carabal cup has seen changes from teams in the top half of the Premier League will you pick a team as if this was a cup final tomorrow night every game's a cup final I think I I do I think when you're managing Newcastle you can't afford to lose any game um and certainly any team I pick is never with with that view It's Always A View to I think this team can win and I think this team gives us the best chance of winning and I'll certainly try to do that tomorrow thank you call Louise and then Martin hi Eddie um do you think Thomas Frank is underrated as a manager and do you think there's some kind of snobbery about him in certain circles because he is quite pragmatic which has really worked well for them he's not a slave to philosophy is that a problem um I don't know if he's underrated because I rate him very highly I don't know how I'd contextualize the the external view um I think he's a very good manager I think that the job that he's done at at brenford is hugely impressive um there's certainly no snobbery to any manager as far as I'm concerned I think when I'm watching a team play and an opposing team play you're looking for a style of play a principle of play um and you're looking for that to be consistent really now whatever that style is I'm not really myself hung up on style really it's about Effectiveness and it's about the ability to win games Thomas has proven over many years that he's able to reduce a team that can win many Premier League games and be really tough to beat so I think there's a lot of respect from my side to him no I was just really meaning about the kind of trend that saw Vincent company go to Bayern Munich when Burnley had just been relegated I mean he's obviously got strength as a coach but there does seem to be that kind of philosophy seems to have come back into um into fashion um you know it's changed from the days when Alan palu said it should be band in football philosophy philosophy sort of um a kind of extreme yeah no I I understand the question and I think there's no right or wrong way to do this job I think in terms of producing a style of play I think it's all down to the individual man manager to choose his path now my path is unique to me I'm sure Thomas is unique to his view on the game and it does tend to go in Trends I do think there is I do see the trend that you're talking about but um I think you've just got to be true to yourself thank thanks Martin morning Eddie um has Associated party transactions which was kind of on a similar theme to what Craig was talking about a which was brought in just after the club was taken over how much more difficult has it made the the possibility if the castle winning the Premier League and therefore making this competition even more important I'd say it's had a dramatic effect on sort of the speed of the journey uh I can't deny that that that has dramatically change due to the rules and and you can feel that um change really especially as everyone's got to grips with PSR and the actual reality of it because I think there was a period of time where it was it was unclear how it would how it would change and what the punishments would be and then of course the punishments became very real for the clubs and now there's nothing more sobering than a thought of a points deduction in terms of changing what you have to do to comply so I think that's been the biggest um change in our reality and what we can and can't do and of course that will affect our ability to change things as quickly as possible from the view of winning trophies and is it a burning desire within yourself to win a major competition I think if it isn't from my viewpoint there's something wrong um that's what we're here to do as a player I was desperate to win a league A cup whatever it was that you the desire for silverware as a player was so strong of course people will tell me I never got close to doing that at all in my career and that was a a burning frustration so now as a manager of course we we're here to win games and set short targets and isolate games and the next game is the most important but ultimately you've got a long-term Vision behind that of I want to desperately want to win a trophy for this football club for the supporters here for their patience for their support um since I've been at the club nothing would please me more and I think in the spirit of Luke doing some research as well there are six English managers who've won something during the Premier League ERA with the last potentially being as far back as 2008 does that make is it important for you to break that run that's not so much of a burning thing in my thoughts really I I don't I don't look at it and go I'm English managers and and it's for Newcastle it it's for this football club uh trying to end the weight for a trophy is the burning desire Thanks Martin just finish we go to Dominic and and Kieran Heidi when you talk about that burning desire can you see it with the players as well yes unless I it's difficult because I think with the players unless I sit down and have an individual conversation with them I I don't think we necessarily go to that point but I think we've discussed it within team meetings within various individual talks because we do encourage the players to to stand up and talk individually to the group that's that's become very apparent there's that same will within all of them I think to um win a trophy here I think they they've seen the weight they've seen the the support they get week and week out wherever we travel in the world the supporters are with us and we'd love speaking on behalf of the players here to reward that support with the trophy um so yeah I think it's there and I think with within everyone at Newcastle now and with that in mind does it feel different around the club before a big game like this a big cup game like this I think there's a an element of excitement that's slightly different to a league game because you know it's a one-off you know that you're either in or out at the end of the game and I think that naturally brings a different feeling to the Premier League the Premier League is it's all encompassing it's there you can't escape it um but of course the league tables forming and shaping with every game but this is I think there's nothing like Cup football I think it's I think the atmosphere I hope tomorrow be matching of that of a a cup competition I think it' be red hot and you know we've got to get our supporters in the game for sure thank you K morning um with the rules now do you think it's going to take a considerable amount of time to to grow revenues because of the way they are yes I think it will I think that's something separate to me of course but I know those talks and those discussions and the willingness to improve our revenue streams that they're ongoing and I'm sure they continue to think of ways that we can do that that can help us in our PSR battle um but yes that's for other people to probably give you more than I know just on on January do you foresee there being value in the loan Market or do you think clubs will want to do you a favor necessarily yeah I think the loan Market is an easy one to sort of Chuck out there and go well let's look at loans but the reality of those loans is very difficult as for the reasons that you've said there really I mean who is going to want to help us not many football clubs so your I think your loan options previous years I think before the rule changes I think there was probably a lot more that you could do I think now it becomes probably more difficult
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,_skQJGBxj2c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_skQJGBxj2c,morning Eddie um obviously you're very disappointed after the brenford game so what's been the the focus this week in terms of putting right the things you were disappointed with yeah good training week for us this week I think a lot of returning to Basics fundamentals of our performance weren't weren't quite right against brenford and I think basically our mentality to defend our goal wasn't there when you concede four goals in any game um you know there's issues you look back at those goals individually it was not the cohesive defending that we've been used to really this season we've been okay defensively the last two games obviously conceded seven goals so that's something we've needed to reflect on we've worked on and hopefully that will show often you've talked about shutting out the noise the outside noise which perhaps comes after a defeat like that I wonder do you put pressure on yourself though or do you feel pressure from from elsewhere in the club when you've had a result like that and you know you need to improve you can never Escape pressure I think it's always there at a club of this size um but I think how you interpret that and handle that is is always individual for me I always surround myself with my work um whether we win lose or draw it doesn't really change the focus of the work might change and what we need to do might change but the work ethic and the standards that I demand of myself is always there and of course when you don't perform in the way that you want you're seeking Solutions and you're seeking um a better way of working so always in that pursuit of that again regardless of results so um I think you're aware of conversations and topics and themes and what people may be saying but I certainly not don't indulge myself in absorbing any of it and obviously the head coach becomes the focus all the time I it's interesting something that Gary O'Neal said after the Wolves game at the weekend just talking about how you know he knows the results from last season were good or many of them were but at the same time you know he he still has pressure on him this season um but he knows that he's a better coach now in his own mind than he was last season he's improving all the time so it's often sort of yeah there's much more to it isn't it than than just the coach but that's always where the focus is yeah I think you you understand that in the the position that we're in there's a lot of scrutiny there's a lot of opinion I understand that I I take criticism um and you know it's part of the job so I've got no issue with it and in some respects I encourage it because if it keeps it away from the players for me that's absolutely crucial because they're the ones that have to perform on the pitch they need to perform in the best Environ uh best environment that we can create so um I think the only way to respond to that is to work harder is to work smarter and to try and get positive results obviously another big blow for you with Callum Wilson's latest setback bearing in mind his injury history um it must be very very difficult for him he's released a statement hasn't he and you can tell you know he's quite emotional about it how do you handle that situation because I mean he's obviously desperate to play You're desperate to have him so so how do you move on from here to get him right yeah I really feel for Callum because we see the work and the dedication the professionalism that he shown um not just in the recovery from this injury but throughout his career really for me he's an inspirational player and uh I think when you're in these moments for him you have to understand how difficult this season has been for him he's had a couple of setbacks when he's looked like he's so close to training and playing regularly and building that resilience that his body needs to perform at this level um he has not cut Corners he's he's gone through a vigorous process to try and keep himself fit and I'm talking about taking himself away from his family for long periods of time to dedicate himself to no distractions to seeking the best specialist opinions in the world that he sometimes has paid for himself so when you go to that level of dedication to um give yourself the best chance to perform and when you see him not get the end result this time that's uh I feel really sad for him but um I back him to come back again and have the mental resilience that he's going to need to fight again and fight hard because we know his qualities and we're desperate to see him play again in a Newcastle shirt and score goals as far as Lester are concerned at the weekend I guess another different kind of test for you again how much more difficult is it when a relatively new manager has come in and perhaps has you know changed things around but how how much more difficult is it then to prepare for a match which is you know a match that you're obviously desperate to win yeah I think it um brings a couple of challenges but nothing that we haven't experienced before um I think rud's come in and he's definitely made tweaks he's definitely uh showed how he wants the team to play so we will anticipate um a slightly different Leicester than maybe it would have been a few weeks ago but we're ready for that and you know we respect them we respect rude and the work that he's done um but we back ourselves as well and we know the importance of this game we're back at home um we want to create a really good feeling we know after the last result we need a reaction thank you thank you Kei hi Eddie hi um just listening to you there on on Calum obviously a huge blow for him because it's a succession of of injuries um it almost feels s from the outside looking in that as much as it's a physical thing this is going to be a real mental thing for him to to get over as well and it sounds as though I mean does he do is he doing anything different anything extra to try and get past all all this just listen just reading his comment as well his statement where he said it's been an emotional roller coaster for me it sounds that it's a really difficult time for him mentally as much as anything else yeah I think when you care as much as Callum does and he cares about himself of course but he cares about the team and the club and his teammates he's desperate to perform and he's desperate to contribute and when you're not able to do that because of your body that's that's a very emotional thing and and he's been outwardly emotional to me um so I I've seen the pain um and the hurt that this uh This Moment's given him but I think that just fuels him I just think that gives him extra motivation to try and come back and to try and um contribute in the way that he wants to because he's such an important player for us we've missed him massively and I guess a delicate situation for for himself in terms of his future with his his contract up at at the end of the season as well I guess there's a danger that we we might not see too much of him between now and then his future has undoubtedly be up in the air yeah I think that's a bit further down the road I think the most important thing currently is that he tries to get himself in the best condition possible to try and play um the injury is not the long long term it's a roughly around an 8-week injury we think so all being well he will be back and then that'll be a crucial period for him but I don't think he has to think about his future I think that's a step Beyond it's just about the short term trying to deal with the initial um injury itself and then fighting back which I know he will and in that position center forward you've obviously just got the two out and out Striker Center forwards in in the shape of cumin and Alex does that concern you a bit because Alex at times this season hasn't been the most durable either are you worried that you're perhaps going to run out of of options there as the season progresses uh obviously callum's injuries are blow in the respect of our strength and depth in that position but I think Alex at the moment touchwood is fit and is looking good scoring goals playing well we're doing a lot of work with Will umla behind the scenes um and he's progressing nicely so I'd have no hesitation um in playing him as well so I think we have two and then we have a a variety of options behind that which hopefully we won't get to use I know you won't want to linger on last weekend too much and you'll want to have parked that and moved on but just a couple of things that the players have said obviously Bruno after the match said that the second half was a mess and then we spoke to Anthony Gordon last night who said teams are finding it all right to certain teams are finding it all right to to play against us now while that's very honest and I think the supporters will appreciate that you will as well it must be difficult to hear yeah but you can't hide what we've delivered I think we we try to be very honest with ourselves and open um don't try and cover cover up what we've delivered you know the second half against brenford the last half an hour against West Ham in losing situations wasn't a great response um I think the manner of goals that we conceded against brenford wasn't good enough but we accept responsibility for that and you can't unfortunately affect the past you can only only affect the future we have to be harder to play against we have to be better defensively um the frustrating thing is when we score goals we seem to be conceding them um you know we look better as an attacking unit against brenford and Liverpool in our last two games than we did the previous group so it's just trying to get all systems firing together I know you've said previously that January will be a difficult window though it is every every year but due to finances does a combination of the inconsistent performances the fact that there's not been too many additions that comeing in strength and is starting to live in the the last couple of Windows and the injury now to to Callum does that make the January transfer window somewhere a window where you need to try and do something try and add I don't think those things affect our ability to trade um in previous Seasons that would be the case because I think you would react to what the team's delivering or an injury situation but I think now with the trading model as it is you're you're much less reactive it's what you can do not what you want to do um I keep saying the same thing about January I wouldn't expect us to be in a position to um be too active in the market as we currently stand now things can change um you know if we trade players of of course that's different but if we don't trade players I would expect us to be quiet than Andy on Eddy I appreciate when you came in obviously Newcastle in Rel allegation trouble given the inconsistency and and trying to solve the inconsistency is this up there with one of the toughest tests so far of new gastle career um I think every every season you have difficult spells within it I I don't know if it's difficult to grade them but of of course you're when you're not winning consistently and you're not in your best Rhythm I'm going to say to you it's difficult and you've got to try and find Solutions as I've said before we're trying to do that we've definitely this week spent a lot of time seeing what tweaks we can make and how we can uh improve different functions of the team but that never stops that's a continuing process for us but certainly a a difficult week for us to navigate through um digest the performance that we delivered but then it's always about being positive very quickly you have to turn it around and then look right okay we've got a game to play and we've got a big week coming up because we've got a mid another midweek game um and a really important competition so very quickly there could be a lot of positive as well so you can never forget that um so we're in that midst of being very honest with ourselves and reflective but then being very positive about what's to come Keith touched upon it there what Anthony was saying last night about how teams are finding it all right to play against Newcastle where as a year or two ago Newcastle were were horrible to play against in the nicest possible way there was no side in the Premier League who enjoyed it how do you get Newcastle playing to that style again to to that dare I say nasty Edge once again I think it's a difficult thing to chase because I think a lot of that comes down to the individual players so that that team that we had in the Champions League qualification season we can't recreate that team you can't go back the characteristics of the players made the team we were horrible to play against um we had that nasty streak within us but I can't necessarily pass that on on to the players we have now different characters different personalities they some of them can't play that way so we have to be better in a different way so if we're not going to be that nasty team we have to be much better in different phases of our play and I think there's really positive signs in some aspects as I don't think it's all negative and even the brenford game there was some positive stuff in there and definitely the third goal changed the direction of the game we didn't respond well to it probably the manner of it hurt us psychologically didn't respond well enough something we'll have to look at but there were some positives in there too I I know you say you know you kind of work even harder when it comes down to a situation like this but obviously this talk out there of attitude and things like how much does that kind of hurt you personally how much does that sting personally when words like attitude are thrown around well it does yeah because I think what I want to see is a reflection of our work on the pitch and our attitude to how we prepare and train the team um so I think when you're coaching and when you're responsible for what you see you want to see not not a reflection of me because if was a reflection of my playing ability I wouldn't want to see that but a reflection of my mental qualities um and I think by and large we've seen that through my time here I think we've seen a team that's been honest hardworking and I still think we're hard working you look at our physical stats week in week out we're one of the best teams in the Premier League physically to deliver that your attitude has to be good now I knew I know there's been some isolated incidents of body language not being to what we want it to be um we've tried to deal with that we've tried to work on that and we continue to do that uh with the players concerned just finally uh how did Newcastle stand team news wise this weekend the likes of Joe willick leis Smiley how are they looking ahead of leester Joe willick um we haven't seen train yet but is making good progress uh Louis Miley's come through a couple of really good games for his continued um return with and is looking really good so I'm pleased with him so yeah thanks Andy no problem Jerry morning hi transfer speculation always spikes before a window of course and you'll be aware that um there's a lot going on at the minute um internationally as well as far as you're concerned should Sandro tanali given your long-term investment in him still be here at the end of January certainly hope so got no plans on losing Sandra I laugh because that just just seems out the blue for me um you know Sandro is a a vital part of what we're doing um our investment in him was long-term um I've been really pleased with him personally we've built up a strong relationship he's um improving in all aspects of his play naturally through the games that he's playing the band was difficult because he's only training and he's not I say only training of course we're doing big pitch work in there but we're not he's not learning from the games the games are the biggest teacher I think so I think now he's in a position where he's getting both and I think we're seeing an improvement in all aspects of his play um this word consistency has been mentioned half a dozen times already is there anywhere on the field in particular you need to make a change to get that consistency back that would lift you back to the top half of the table is it defense for example you mentioned characters have changed over the last year or so is it defense Midfield somewhere else I think when you're you're using the word consistency and we're searching for a sort of a rhythm in our play that is there uh week in week out I I don't think it's one aspect I think it comes down to um the mental side of the game more than the the Tactical or the technical delivery um I think we've even with within games we've had really high moments and then some disappointing moments I think back to several Gam games where we've conceded out of nothing we're not under pressure in a game even brenford game we for the away team we're under no pressure and we concede a goal and we're one nil down very early in the match and that changes the Dynamics of how we think so it's cutting out those sort of individual mistakes that have crept into our game in the last two games defensively because I don't think it's a structural problem and then of course confidence builds from that and um that's something that we need to protect at all times finally for me um you saw Sven bmann training the other day any news on him how's he doing he's been training for a while I don't think it's said an isolated incident he's been training consistently now for around four weeks um but that was the plan so we uh taking obviously medical advice and trying to follow the right protocols for the injuries that he's had um sorry the injury that he's had to try and make sure that we give him the best chance to stay fit so I think the plan is late December very early January at the earliest that he will be available for the first thing thank you Daman I think there seem to be some suggestion that Nick Pope was was carrying a little knock is is he okay yeah he's carried a knee injury this week um initially we thought it was um nothing so I think he's seeking some specialist opinion today and then we'll see if if he's available for tomorrow just just going back to Sandra obviously there was a speculation in the week which he come come out and denied do you sort of have to prepare yourself for another month of that speculation and if so given the impact that had in the summer are you concerned at the effect it could have on your players again yeah I don't think from my side we won't or encourage any speculation on any of our players leaving I don't think it helps us in any way I don't think it helps the players because it just can only distract you take you away from what you need to to concentrate on certainly I don't encourage it I don't see that being a big issue for us um we want to keep our Squad together and ideally we'd want to add the other way that might not be possible but we so certainly don't we be losing our best players than got a Luke and then Lee Ryder um you sounded more despondent probably I think most supporters picked up on it your your the tone of your voice that your postmatch interviews how quickly do you shake that off and are you feeling [Laughter] despondent that's certainly not despondent um I can probably honestly say after the brenford game I was very disappointed um all those emotions attached to that sad whatever whatever you want to call it because I think we we have standards to hit and demands to match um most importantly from ourselves and we didn't hit those levels so of course when you don't deliver what you want to deliver you're sad you're disappointed but that very quickly turns to right what can we do almost within seconds to be honest you can't dwell in the that moment you have to go right you have to find us a positive way forward so what's that going to be how are we going to work differently what can we improve what can we change um how can we affect the players so all those decisions and actions have been taken this week and hopefully we see that reflected on our performance against Leicester but certainly no negative emotions because you can't hold them for any length of time um been in the game long enough to know they're only around the corner disappointments it's the easiest thing to suffer in football the hardest thing is for long-term success um and consistent results um but you're always working towards that so that's what we've done this week what sort of support communication have you received internally from from those above you during this spell I don't really seek it to be honest look I I don't I've never been that type of person I'm not I don't know if the right word uh needy um or seeking assurances or looking above me going let me engage in conversations to see how the land lies that's that's not that's not me my work is always with the players and that's my main focus is to try and affect them positively my future will be dictated by the results on the pitch not by me seeking anything just finally is confidence a problem I mean you're you're speaking very well is confidence becoming a problem with the players uh I'm hesitating because that's difficult for me to answer I'm not playing I'm seeing and preparing the team um but I'm not having their emotions on the pitch I don't think so currently but of course the longer that we don't play in the way that we want to or get results um that may start to be an issue I certainly would ask everybody connected with Newcastle that doesn't become an issue at home because our home form has always been the Bedrock of our success here and the players love playing at home love playing in the environment and I know we have a duty to um keep that environment ourselves by Body Language attitude work rate um all those things that the the supporters will feed off so that's our job but that environment at home is fundamental to Our Success we have to keep that positive and that's down to us absolutely morning Eddie morning um you've obviously had some famous wins at Newcastle um perhaps some of the not forgotten wins are in the history books though your first win against Burnley you won one nil and I remember a game at leads you went won one nil and there were turnning points is that sort of thing you're looking for in this game against Leicester well if it means we go on if it means we win this game and go on a winning run then we look at it in hindsight as a turning point then yeah absolutely I think the difficulty in those moments you don't know didn't know at leads that was going to be a turning point for us I sort of felt the Burnley game was a big moment because we just needed to win however we did it we just needed to win the leads game now we look back and go well that was that was a massive win for us because I think it just gave us belief again it gave us um especially off to what had happened before CU I think we'd just traveled to Saudi if my memory is right and it there felt a really togetherness in the group that we're going to do this now we're in a different moment now in a different season different feelings but we have a big week to come we're under no Illusions this game the brenford game at home they're massive games for us they can Elevate us and change our season positively so yeah if that means a turning point we'll we'll take anything that comes and it's it's easy to some names get sort of pulled down by the Doom and Gloom but the Run they've been on includes draws and you know it's not like had any hammering in games so is it easy to remind the players of of what you've had not that long ago not Forest wasn't that long ago for example yeah you're right but the uh the modern day game is based on really the last result or the last couple of results and we're sort of aware of that I think in the last group of games you're absolutely right for me the Liverpool game was a brilliant example of what we can be yes we didn't win the game but our first half performance in particular was standout um a brilliant performance so it's not that's that's one game away that's so close um but the frustration for us is that we showed that version of ourselves that day and then the version that we showed against brenford so we're looking for our best version of ourselves all the time consistently um The Players want the same thing and it's up to us to it just if there are any goalkeeping issues you've got a very strong goalkeeper Brigade here so I guess that wouldn't be an issue if if Nick is going to be missing yeah we do we have a very strong unit we have a very good experienced team of goalkeepers if you look at the experience behind Nick which is a great thing for us to utilize so let's see what happens with Nick today um but yeah we back all the goalkeepers we have got the Jordan Scot and Craig T the word it's under pressure often come about sorry come back hi Eddie um Eddie you talked about January there and we kind of all know the difficulties that there are clearly The Game Changer in that situation is to sell a bigname player now if not in January in the summer have you had internally as a recruitment team conversations about that option and where do you stand on it because clearly losing a big player has massive ramifications in terms of trying to replace them and yet where Newcastle are it potentially is the only way you can bring in three four five players to to really change the squad if only it was that easy I I don't think I don't think there's a wish or a want from anyone to sell our best players um I get the question and I understand the the the train of thought but there's so much more that goes into it um than the simple decision that that you've presented um we're desperate to take the team forward positively not step back in any way um but the best players we have they're like gold dust you I've said that many times they're difficult to find you're not going to pick them up off the off the street when you have them you got to cherish them and and really care for them and um try to make the environment as strong as you can so they want to stay as part of that so uh yeah that's sort of a mixed answer for me but it's not as easy as that and just one on willisa who you kind of see he's he's kind of getting there what have you felt and I know you probably want want to go into to real specifics but what have you felt you've needed to work on with him over these last three four months what what what when he came in what were you seeing that you didn't feel ready to put him in straight away that needed to improve change whatever I just think it's a a huge jump for him um in in every way naturally um I've been really really impressed by him so his attitude to learning is top he's there with a variety of coaches after training every day working on different aspects of his game and I think that's the I think that's the the thing it's not it's no there's not one thing for will it's right if you fix this or improve this then it's just a time it's time to improve all aspects of his game his understanding you don't suddenly just land and come a premier league Striker you have to work towards that as a young player he's making great strides I've been really impressed with him um I think we sort of now working with him a few months um he's reader than he's ever been um and obviously with callum's injury now he's going to have to step up he's going to have to grab any opportunity that comes his way he has all the attributes I'm sure every supporter that watched him play in the brief times that he's played is got he's he's big he's quick very quick he's strong um there's just a refined and the only thing that can sort of bring that is time but he's certainly getting there against time a little bit so we might need toit answer single questions if that's okay we got to Jordan Craig and then to Dominic I think I always feel Under Pressure um and I'm not trying to be clever with my answer but genuinely I always feel under pressure under pressure in different ways um depending on results Under Pressure to keep winning Under Pressure to win if you if you're not winning Under Pressure to deliver for the players under pressure to work in the right way to be a role model for the for all the people of Newcastle so I always feel Under Pressure I don't feel negatively Under Pressure to sort of affect my mood or um my emotions I try very hard to keep them under control to be the best person I can be for the players when they need me thanks Jord Craig yeah one question i' make a good one uh it's a big p question now a lot of things go into the performance of the professional football there the isolation what you guys do with the training of course but beyond that I think there's an acceptance now that the project here at least in the short term has slowed and has changed Direction perhaps to what we thought it was 18 months ago does that permeate the dressing room and if so how do you deal with that with regard to your players that's a good question that's probably more than one question in in in your question um how do I answer that yeah yeah I think players are very astute human beings um I always say players feel everything at a football club they're the most perceptive people because they're on the front line they're the on that's delivering for us so whatever is going on at a football club I think they're absorbing it and I think naturally like we've said many times PSR has had a um an effect on the football club um that we haven't been able to drive and reach as quickly as we wanted to initially and that's been halted somewhat in various ways I think of course they felt that they've been aware of that um I think the challenge for me is for that not to affect performances to affect mood to affect the belonging to the football club um I'd say that's easier maybe in some cases than others um depending on the player situation but I will say fundamentally I think when you look at the squad they're all committed to the club they all want to do well I don't think there's any um other thought in the players minds and they know the responsibility on their shoulders um and together hopefully we can turn the corner thanks CRA Dominic morning Eddie morning um I'll just keep things simple but Callum Wilson you spoke about the vigorous process to get him fit and to keep him fit just how did his injury come about and is it something that could occur again in the future um his injury came on Saturday against brenford very very late in the game it was an innocuous moment there wasn't a big a big moment I think he just felt un discomfort in his hamstring I can't remember which one um of course there there's a chance that can happen again because I'd say the same to any player of any injury at any time they they can they can happen and they can strike sometimes without reason um but yeah he did it in the game and of course I've tried to manage his minutes sensibly on the pitch knowing how important he is sometimes these things happen and there's nothing you can do about it next up Kier morning we've seen how many goals Callum has scored for the club how difficult is it to find a player like that in the market when you're under restrictions I don't like using the word impossible um because I don't believe in that but as close as you can get to it because callum's got the experience the knowhow the all the things that you need to to deliver that he he would be one of the few people that that can that's available to us um so yeah it's a big blow but as I say I've seen this many times that you get an injury to someone and I'm trying to put a positive spin on this and it opens up a door for someone else in in whatever capacity so whether that's for for willisa or for someone else to step forward and to Showcase their talents then so be it and um Callum will work his way back to finish thanks Ken sim finish hi Eddie um if players believe that the project is slowing and they can't get to the very top of this club is it is it harder to keep them and is it harder to recruit from that position um yeah I'd say it's being honest that that would be a challenge for us dep but again depending on the player's situation and his career objectives and his age Etc a lot goes into it of course if we feel we're able to develop quicker that that will suit the players's needs and wants but it's not just what the player needs and wants it's what we need and want it's what the club who hold his registration in his contract need and want most importantly and as I said I've had no player knock on my door say that they want to leave um I think we've got a a good group of players that want success and that are together in that Pursuit
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,V91dSDyK3Xo,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V91dSDyK3Xo,I'll start with a A dodgy pun because bees this weekend but um I think everyone's here still still buzzing after Wednesday night's game how how I know it was bad wasn't it how difficult is it though after a game like that which has taken taken so much out of you I guess you know physically and emotionally to then get prepared for another game so soon yes it's one of the challenges that we face I think going into this game I think the um the players would have felt the the high of the game I think there's always that uh certainly as a player I felt that after any game there's there's always a come down um but I think it will be a steep one after the Liverpool game and I think our challenge this weekend is to find a way to um hit the same levels of intensity and mental qualities that we showed on Wednesday so quickly bearing in mind everybody played well on Wednesday night what's your thinking and behind changing the team because obviously as I mentioned you know a lot of um physical um you know issues after the game you'd have thought just just just um players tired after the game so what's your thinking behind that yeah again that's um something we're going to discuss at length today and try and find the right balance between change and um consistency of selection I think there's a few things to note there were some Tide bodies in the in the um in the team half the game Sandy was getting cramped with about 10 15 minutes to go um anony Gordon was fatigued at the end uh of his performance which was very very good and naturally when you empty like that and you give so much to the the game there's going to be a hit and I thought Alex worked extremely hard and um he was tired at the end so but our job is to refuel um regroup and go again what's a another great opportunity for us I know you spoke after the game about that consistency word it's something that comes up quite a lot and I guess there was a huge contrast wasn't there particularly between that game and the and the West Ham home game um Palace I was a different game in between as well um brenford provides a different test I suppose and bearing in mind that their home record too um you know how what do you take from the Liverpool game that you need to sort of bring into the to the brenford game to maintain that consistency I think as always it's attitude attitude is everything to to any team against Liverpool you saw the the correct attitude you saw the correct um mental preparation from the players when we entered the pitch no doubt in the early exchanges of the game that we were in a good place really good energy by in Midfield desire to win the ball we were really good in Jews and gradually then when you're good in those small areas um your bigger performance um looks different and I thought athletically we looked really good the running speed of our front players the battling qualities of our Midfield against a a top team I thought we especially in the first half won that battle in there I wanted to ask you about Fabian Sher as well I was going to even before that equalizer on on Wednesday evening just because of what he brings to the to the side as a a center half but also so much so much more than that and he he's important to he so important to you in an attacking sense as well isn't he I mean he probably is the the biggest bargain bearing a man what he cost in the Premier League isn't he he's got to be up there looking at the histories transfers I think yeah fabian's got those Midfield qualities at Center back he's got the creative eye that has been so important for us in our buildup phases I think I was sat here the other day and asked questions about our attacking output and I think part of my answer was that everyone attacks everyone has a responsibility to attack I think Fabian really carries that burden and how he distributes the ball and his creative ey I thought he used the ball really well against Liverpool both long and short it's not always the long pass that's the effective one it's the short ones that can connect but his goal is sort of rounding everything up it's just a great example of him I mean how he scored that goal from that angle is is beyond me certainly not something I could do as a center back but he has that technical ability to adapt and he scored some wonderful goals for us brentford's home record's the best in the Premier League as you'll be well aware and they also have a bit of a reputation for for coming out of the traps very quickly and scored a lot of very early goals a bit earlier in the season as well so um I guess that sort of plays into your thinking in terms of how you really need to to start the game well obviously well I think whenever you go away from home the the intention that you set in the game is key um you know the early exchanges give you a lot of Clues to to how the game's going to go we need to start well as you say brenford has scored a lot of early goals we're well aware of that um they're still a very good setpiece team as well so we're going to have to be on our guard and at the end of the weekend you could be in 13th Place you could be as high as fifth it's a little bit ridiculous how congested it is there now but I guess looking at that table it just shows that the opportunity is there put a run of results together and you know you can be flying yeah there's a lot of ifs and butts there and I think the the key for us in this moment is to be optimistic I think is to be very very positive because the opportunities are there and we have to take them the best way to take them is to be very glass half full um what's happened has happened this season we've been slightly inconsistent we've been um at times really good at times not so good but that's in the past and I think I still believe that we're going to get better through the season I still believe there's more to come so I'm very positive about what we can deliver thank you thanks thank you Edie you mentioned um the come down that you would expect after a like that just to give us a little bit of insight when the games are so close together and you've got a big game like that preceding brenford away what do you do behind the scenes do do they do they allow to train at all or what what do they do in terms of recovery yeah they do loads of loads of the the classic recovery tools that we use so we've got really good facilities now internally so um ice baths and you know we've got leading massage therapists and L lots of different tools that we use in for red etc etc could go on cryotherapy Chambers and and the lads utilize all of those things but nothing beats good oldfashioned good diet sleep they're the fundamentals really um so yeah we hope that physically we'll be fine mentally there's work for me to do to try and get the the players in the right place but I think a lot ultimately falls down on the individual players the individual players have to know that we have another game and for me there's no category of games every game is of equal importance this is a massive one for us um we need to find a way to win and as I said earlier with the league being so tight that can make a big difference you've you've beaten Arsenal at home Spurs at home Chelsea at home in the cup obviously drawing against Liverpool could easily have won that match but then you've slipped up against West Ham at home Brighton at home loss against fulam away are you scratching your head as to how that has come around this season yeah to a degree yes because I think those games that you mentioned where we haven't performed our best still a big frustration for me um I don't want to use cliches uh so I'll try and stay away from them but the Premier League this year has been not just us that's been in that position the most consistent team have been Liverpool and that's why they are where they are and the challenge for everyone in the league is to is to find that run um and we're very much a team in that mold and we have the ability to do it we need the mental qualities to be as good as our our qualities in other areas is that a worry for you that that's been been the case and it feels as though from the outside looking in it feels as though the team are performing better against the the so-called bigger teams I think that's been in our makeup for a while um and it is a frustration because we know what we're capable of and it's yeah the missing ingredient is to try and deliver that regardless of who you're playing and regardless of where you're playing um I think we had that in our Champions League season and that's why we're able to achieve what we did that year I think regardless of position it didn't really matter you saw the same Newcastle week in week out it's not for the want of trying I can tell you the players are all committed to delivering that sometimes um for whatever reason um things happen I think for now and we can't go back is trying to affect the future and try and make sure that we are finding solutions to problems and trying to make the players aware of what we need to do the performance of well of all the team but particularly Alexander isack must have really boyed you the other night he was unpl both times against for Jo van dig on that form do you think he is the the best striker in the Premier League yeah I think I've asked that question uh a couple of weeks ago and I'm reluctant to sort of now answer it in the same way I think Alex has got undoubted qualities he is as you say on Wednesday night I thought he was irresistible the challenge for him as well as the team and he is probably more reliant on the team than anyone else because he's at the top end of the pitch but it's to try and find the the keys to delivering that um week in week out which is very hard to do because obviously teams are focused on stopping him so but he makes a big difference to the team when he's in that kind of form and I think that was shown best by his goal what what a strike that was um not just the strike as well but the pass from Bruno the movement to receive the ball in the way that he did and I think when you see Alex and Anthony and Jacob Lincoln play in the way that they did um hopefully great signs for us in the future if we can find um the environment to give him the platform to perform like that we've not seen Sandro and Bruno in the same team too many times and particularly with Bruno and the sorry Sandro should I say in the in the six I feel like that he was the other night how pleased were you with the way the two of them operated together and does that give you real food for thought moving forward yeah I thought the Midfield three worked really well I think they had to in that game um Liverpool are very good in Midfield they have a lot of movement and rotations in there themselves so I think we had to find a way to trying to control that Midfield area and I think the biggest compliment I can give them against three really good opponents I thought we were very good in that department especially in the first 45 minutes as I said um I thought their positioning on the pitch was really good there was a lot of fluid movements a lot of rotations but still the structure was what I wanted it to be so yeah great signs for the future I think Bruno ends up creating one goal from the sixth position one goal slightly higher up uh and that's great to see just finally from me um Kieran missed out the other night I think you said afterwards it was it was illness how how is he now ahead of tomorrow's game yeah he's improving do you expect him to be in the squad we'll see you today okay Che no problem Andy on you talk about attitude so far I noticed the the war Flags display on Wednesday change and it read get into them was that the sort of attitude that you saw from your players throughout back game do you think that message yeah I think that's always Our intention that was our intention against West Ham and I thought judging that if you watch that game back taking the goals out I think for 60 minutes you'd have seen that no one really wants to talk about that after the game because we've lost and I understand that um but that was very much especially in Midfield again especially in that area where the Jews the the challenges the loose the loose balls the second balls are going to end up I thought invariably the uh the three Midfield who picked up a lot through determination athleticism um that get into the psyche is is where we want to be we want to be a progressive team we don't want teams to enjoy playing against us they're all really important qualities Dan and Bruno reached 100 Premier League appearances for Newcastle United um both incredible players in their own right for Newcastle do do those sort of Milestones get talked about in Camp by yourself to the players on not and also how played do you for them both reaching that Milestone I think Bruno was certainly aware because he mentioned it we had a discussion um Dan no um but I think they're important to players it was important to me not so much that I was when I was playing looking at you know every game how many ever played but when a milestone was coming around or someone would make you aware of it you think that's that's nice that that's good I'll appreciate that one day um when I look look back on my career and I think when you play a certain amount for of games for a team I think it sort of solidifies your attachment to that team I think both players have given so much and really contributed to our recent success both really passionate about Newcastle both um great people they want to win two two absolute winners uh and I hope they can keep going speaking of Bruto I asked you about this last week he he finally won toss I don't think it was lost on St james' park or Dan who seem to celebrate in the Huddle as well beforehand that he'd actually won one yeah I don't I don't know because I was asking a couple of questions about this I don't know if it is Bruno winning or losing a toss I'm not sure as the home captain that it's his call I think it's more the away captain that makes the call so I don't know if he's winning or losing but certainly it's not been coming on our side so uh that was good to see one fall in our favor I know we talk about team news just on Sven botman you mentioned a couple of weeks ago that he's he's starting to resume a little bit of training with the first him how is he getting on what's the update on him he's doing well um so yeah the initial moments in training were very much passive and making sure he didn't get um do too many jewels working on his technical work but now he's he's fully training we've done a couple of 11 v1s with him he's looked good in those 11 v1s um he's still a few weeks off playing competitively um but he looks and feels good um it's all about Rhythm for Sven now it's all about getting those game Dynamics the pitch geography back um things that he would normally do on autopilot he needs to ReDiscover how to do it um but it's just been a big boost to have him in training he's a obviously a big guy he's a big presence and we've certainly missed him um you talked about the potential come down for the players following the Lial game and the importance of attitude how do you manage the attitude and get it right for grandford yeah I think we've got some work to do in that respect because you know our game preparation yesterday was about recovery today is about our game prep and um making sure we get the right messages to the players the right tactical information uh and always the right attitude attitude is the key defining factor to any game and I think if you get that right with the ability we have we we back ourselves so um it's a tough assignment at brenford it always is we've been there a number of times we know what we'll face and brenford have been in good form this season so um it's a I think it's a really good game for us to attack and obviously looking forward ahead of this to the to the quarterfinal I mean how much would you going to be able to learn from from brenford yeah I think you yeah sorry yeah I think you always learn from every opponent I think that's one of the beauties of the league where the games come around and you you tweak certain things but the the cup game's zero relevance to us at this moment it's all about the Premier League and trying to uh lift ourselves up the table thank you we'll start with Louise we'll go to Le Rider Lise a lot of questions in in one there I'll try and go step by step um I think against a team like Liverpool like there were moments certainly when we High pressed and we were really aggressive but I think there's moments we have to be smart and I thought we were especially in Midfield as I say I thought midfielders got the balance and controlled those moments really well because the impulse is always to go but you got to know the right time to press certainly there were some really key attacking counterattacking moments for us off the back of that I think we're when we're at our best we always have that element in our game we've got Pace we've got got uh technical qualities um I think counterattacking is a real weapon for us probably haven't seen it enough especially ending up in goal goals for us this year um I think we've had a loads of really good moments where the last pass has eluded us or the Finish hasn't quite been right I think we need to be um have the ability to play in every way I I don't see one phase of play being necessarily more important than any other you have to Counterattack well you have to defend counterattacks well you have to be good with the ball you have to be good without the ball the the Premier League is such a test in every different way that um we want to be uh multi-talented in every area and another another question on a different theme this rainbow laces campaign I mean it's OB been quite contentious with s s game and obviously there's also the thing about um Stone in trans rights over women's rights but that's a can of worms we don't need to against that Ved issue um but is it something that you would endorse and back and think it's important for football or do you think football shouldn't be getting involved in it and is there debate in your your dressing room no I don't think there's any debate in my dress room not that I've heard for me um I think these campaigns are brilliant because it highlights awareness and I think sport is a great vehicle to do that and to help Society in any way that we can I think we have to use sport for the good Le morning Eddie morning Sven bman been pitched in training a few times um how much of a decision is that going to give you given how good D Burn's been and how good fabian's been this season yeah I think that's a a long way off at the moment um but certainly if and when s returns at his best level I think just think he's a brilliant addition to the squad and then be up to me to Define to find the sorry the right balance um in the team but it's not something at the moment that is in my conscious thinking my conscious thinking is very much in the next few games and step by step but Sven was a massive player for us and I don't think you can underestimate how much we've missed his certain qualities that he he brought the height of course um but his technical delivery in our buildup was second tan he had this beautiful switch of play that used to bring Kieran into play um in our Champions League qualification season where we had a great Dynamic on that side of the pitch on the right hand side of the pitch a lot of the time through sven's distribution so I think we've really missed those qualities um and he's a great lad as well he's very popular in the dressing room so I think he's got um a lot of key attributes that we we've missed but he got to be right for San he's got to build up in the right way and we've got to look after him because um it's not an easy injury or a simple injury to uh recover from so has got to he's now in the final stages he's got to manage that situation well we certainly don't want to make a mistake in the last few weeks just done obviously we sat and watched the Simon Jordan interview with interest um did you feel that was an important interview to do because a lot of the things he mentioned in that interview spoke about this Narrative of being the richest club in the world did you feel it was important to to get that out to the to the wider fan base what what you actually dealing with in terms of finance and stuff like that um I don't think that was necessarily my intention because I didn't know what questions he was going to ask so I can't lead the interview in that way unless he asked you know sort of goes onto that topic um I think it's always important for me to speak on behalf of Newcastle in a in the right way and to try and educate people on the the truth behind the reality of how we're working and what we're doing uh I thought it was a challenging interview I have to say um I was exhausted after it but uh pleased I got through it hopefully unscathed finally obviously Ellie Anderson and Min got sold in the summer something you didn't want to do going into this next window are you concerned that you might have to do something similar to that with potentially sell another young player or sell someone you don't want to sell just to sort of balance the books if you like yeah what I say on that is that trading is essential both in and out to to the model of PSR I think the days where teams don't sell players um unless your revenue streams are so big are gone so I think our revenue streams aren't where we want them to be ultimately we're trying to grow them so I think trading in and out is is going to be essential hopefully it's not players you know that we're forced to sell like we were in that situation with a couple of days to go uh with deadlines approaching hopefully it's in a more stable setting but you can't guarantee anything than got to Jordan then Dominic just on the lack of consistency is that down to mentality rather than the build the season is it harder for your team to get motivated against the likes of brenford opposed to Li Manchester City yeah I don't think it's as clear as motivated I think that would be and I understand the question but I think that' be an easy thing to say I think it's the dynamic of those games is very different the challenge of those games is different um we haven't adjusted well enough to those but it's certainly not a case of the players aren't motivated for the games it certainly can sort of you can make that suggestion afterwards but I think obviously internally you know there's a lot more to the dynamic than that um The Players want to do well the players want to achieve the players want to win they're committed to doing that I see that in their training in the preparation and then the delivery sometimes this season hasn't been right um and we're try and find ways to improve that but it's C I have to make that clear it's certainly not for a lack of motivation or a lack of desire and just on Sandro T the two last two games have been like a bit of a breakthrough for him what what has changed for sandre um I probably wouldn't put it that way I think he's he's done really well in the last two games I've been absolutely delighted with his performances I think there's been a good most importantly for me there's been a good dynamic in Midfield I think that's been really pleasing to see it's not about the individual players when you're putting players together it's about the how that affects the team um so I thought the Chelsea game was just as good in the cup I thought he did really well there I thought the Nottingham Forest Performance Off the Bench I thought he was a game changer there so I think he's performed really well in in recent weeks Dominic just to follow up to that why do you think it's taken so long for Sandro Tali to be used in that six Ro and be used effectively well because we have Bruno in there who's been absolutely magnificent for us for a long long period of time so before changing the dynamic of of that role for Bruno which has been you know you look at the best sixes in the Premier League Bruno would be absolutely right up there for me and he's the fulcrum of the team so you change that Dynamic and it there's benefits of course if a player has different qualities but there's also a knock on effect the other way so but I felt that it was time to look at it but it doesn't mean that the dynamic or sorry that position has changed because I think against Liverpool there was a lot of rotation there was a lot of utilizing players in different positions so a different kind of structure for us and brenford one of the best attacking teams in the Premier League this season despite losing Ivan Tony in the summer do they serve as a reminder of how teams can adapt and arguably improve to losing such important players yeah absolutely because I think the game never stops and you can't get fixated with um believing one player makes the team it's never that that clearcut and um sometimes to evolve the team you have to lose a player and then you can bring a different Dynamic to the side so they've done that really well brenford I have to say their recruitment always historically has been very very strong I think that's continued to be the case um they're a different team without Ivan in it but they're still now you can see with the goals scoring a very effective team got a lot of pace in the front areas certainly a lot for us to try and control got Chris lugan and Craig more Eddie you obviously asked about trading outwards have you been given a clear picture yet heading into January as to what exactly the position is for example can you bring someone in without moving somebody out or does someone have to be sold for you to be able to bring players in you want a lot of clarity there Chris I'm not sure I can give it to you um yeah yeah I mean of course I know the the pitcher um but the the the issue with PSR and the issue with um our position is nothing's ever clearcut because it's it's not i' I'd need some time to sit down and sort of go through everything with you which I'm not going to do anyway so that's irrelevant um we will try and do our best I keep saying the same things we'll try and do our best nothing's absolutely fixed at the moment there'll be a lot of twists and turns but um the want from everyone internally is to try and improve uh the squad if we can do we will if we can't we won't um what did you make of Anthony Gordon's um goal celebration on Wednesday night which what you mean blah blah blah goal celebration you'd have to show me cuz I you want me to get up please I'm not going to do that I don't know you do not know can you rubbish question then starget um all right well we'll just leave that um is the challenge for the your top players Anthony would fall into that category he seemed to be saying there' been a lot of talk he did a there you go there you go he did that blah blah blah blah blah see I have done um is the challenge for all your top players Anthony Bruno um ASAC is it to do um the top players do it week in week out is that what you want from them now because he has taken some crits they have taken some crits well of of course yeah I mean that's what they want that's what we all want everyone connected with Newcastle want to see those players expressing themselves free to play and at their best now during the season you're always going to have ups and downs there's always going to be good and bad phases for you uh I think it goes with the territory when you're performing well in the Premier League you're going to be talked about you're going to be talked about positively and you're going to be talked about negatively as we all are when you're under the spotlight and in the news so dealing with that taking some stuff in taking the majority of stuff away from your head is is key and then just enjoying your football ultimately I think if the players are enjoying what they're doing they'll play at their best level so I think it's really simple for formula really for us to to try and help the players with um but I'll be really pleased to see him keep doing that celebration if it means he's scoring goals I think I've taken up thank you very much morning Eddie just on the Midfield I was waiting for it cow good that's good I enjoyed that no mfield fre to do uh yeah you looked at Tottenham last night and they've beaten Man City 10 days ago 4-0 they've then drone a film to Fulham they've then lost away to Bournemouth and you could level that at you guys a little bit this season is and there's a word for that with regards Tottenham you don't want to get that word associated with your team is the difference between elite players elite players do it every week and is that what you're going to tell those guys who think they are Elite you know without mentioning names they do they do it every week don't they and at the moment your top guys AR in a way yeah I think as I said regarding Luke's question I think the the better players in the league are the better players because they repeatedly Do It um it's easier to do it on the odd occasion here and there and show how good you are in in phases I have to say though I think last year and the year before the players were consistent uh in that respect it is harder for the more creative players to find that consistency because of course teams as we do will try and work out plans against you to nullify your strengths but then you have to keep evolving your game and you have to keep finding ways to to be effective um there' be different reasons behind every individual's performance I won't go into them but that the there's always a story behind the player it's not a clear as just well perform the conditions have to be right the player has to feel right um you know everything has to be right for a player now to be at their very best consistently and that's what we're trying to help them with um and that's everyone in the team that's no individuals you know from my perspective pointing fingers at anybody uh we all want the same thing and we'll work towards that thanks great K finish morning is the way newcast going to have to recruit going to be different moving forward obviously we've seen in the past maybe there's been a pattern in some ways does that have to change now um it's a difficult one to answer I think every transfer will be different um I'm not saying no to that there may well have to be a an adjustment but I think it's it has to be taken on indiv individual basis so signings for us like willisa which um was very much with a view to potential in the future um and a player that we really like will be a different kind of signing of course to Alex who was bought in for the here and now and to hit the ground running straight away but so I think it very much depends on what your need is but I do get the question that if you know PSR will continue to be an issue for us for the next few years ahead that we're going to have to be smart and I think that's the key thing we just going to have to be clever with what we do doesn't mean we can't make hopefully you know big signings and um players for the Here and Now who are ready to play um but maybe not all under that category at the same time you face brenford are there learnings you can take from how they recruit and compete yet still different Dynamic and I think different expectations I don't think you can compare two clubs recruitment really because everyone has different uh objectives I think they've recruited really smartly and they obviously use a data model and they done it very very well we don't have that that those infrastructures in place but I do think the the expectations of both clubs are very different
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,bUHrpNXFZSA,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUHrpNXFZSA,hi Eddie good morning can we just start with an update on Alexander isach how he is and is he in your squad for Liverpool well he took a knock to his hip um wasn't able to carry on we haven't seen him in training yet um don't think it's a long-term injury we'll wait and see with a with an impact injury like that although impact injuries can be serious is it just a case of rest for him over the the weekend yeah it'll be time it'll be pain management um and how quickly the injury settles down and what about any other players because I think you said after Crystal Palace that Dan Burn's been carrying a problem so how is he and and are there any other knocks yeah Dan got through the game really well I have to say I mean um when he got suspended we use that as a chance to try and um rest his ankle and get it 100% fit get him 100% fit but um he had a mix time in that period where he didn't play as in he he didn't feel right he's been to see a couple of Specialists um really minimal training time I thought he was outstanding All Things Considered against Crystal Palace and uh after the game he felt okay when you looked back at Crystal Palace and what happened on Saturday since the game finished what have you learned what conclusions have you reached uh well I'm still replaying that last couple of minutes um in in my head and and also just the little things that we got wrong in that goal which would have been a massive win for us but it didn't happen and we have to accept that and um yeah we didn't defend across well enough ultimately it's cost us the game right at the end of the match um I thought the performance was okay defensively um I thought there was certain aspects of the performance in with the ball that was good until the final third final third I thought we were we were poor in other matches when the goals haven't come there have tended to be quite a lot of chances that you've had that you haven't taken felt different on Saturday why do you think that is and what's the solution yeah I think when you go back the the last two games we've had we had West Ham where we created a lot of chances especially in that first 60 minutes and um thought we looked like a really good team we didn't take them Crystal Palace was different but but in some senses what I said after the game once we' scored and we were leading the game we' done our job to that point um as much as we still want to score and we want go 2-0 the the game had never been a free flowing performance from us and if we had won the game one nil we' have said that was a a brilliant sort of away day for us where we didn't play well but we got a great win and we didn't defend the cross well enough and then the whole Focus comes back on sort of the performance with the ball and our attacking output was very low I'm not going to deny that we hide that um so certainly we're looking at a few things and trying to make tweaks what did you make of Liverpool and their performance against Manchester City on Sunday yeah I think very good very strong um you know what a week they've had when you look at Real Madrid and then Manchester City um two very good performances I think they're a team at the moment playing with full confidence they've got um still sort of the Hallmark of Liverpool under Jurgen kot but obviously an's now an slot's had his uh time with the team and he's tweaked certain things it makes them a really difficult proposition because they've added new strengths um players are playing well the front players are notoriously very strong so it's going to need to be a good defensive performance from us and certainly we're going to have to pose them questions the other way as well and it's not as if you haven't your team haven't played well against Liverpool but you've not managed to get that result against them it's been a long time since any Newcastle team won against Liverpool even though players and managers and teams change can it become a psychological thing against one opponent one other club uh well let's hope not I don't think so certainly from my viewpoint I don't prepare the game that way I prepare the game to try and win um with a fresh set of eyes every time you play a new opponent or an opponent because teams change and evolve as I said every time you play them I think uh the games we've had against them have been as you say they've been tight the um especially the home games have been really difficult losses for us to take the last one was a painful one that we remember from last year but I think every time you play an opponent like Liverpool you learn new things um and yeah I think it' be a great occasion love playing under the lights at St James's Park um I'm sure it' be a great atmosphere and we need to create that to uh make it uncomfortable as we can for them thank you thanks Rosa Nick hi Eddie um how how difficult was it to pick up the players after the result at the weekend um I mean match is obviously coming around very quickly is it difficult to ssy them up for the the Liverpool game or is that one of their games that you sort of naturally feel excited about yeah if we have to you know motivate the players for this game there's something wrong we won't have to I think the players will be knowing that the dangers that Liverpool possess and that in some some sense heightens your uh senses but also there's an excitement about the game and there's um an opportunity for us to to grow and attack a game like this will be uh will be a brilliant thing and I think we can go into the game of confidence although you can look at results in loads of different ways um I think generally our performances have been improving as The Season's gone on and uh yeah we always try to play at home with no fear and obviously Liverpool pulling away at the top of the league I mean do do you see this as a bit of a I don't suppose a manager can ever see it as a Bonus Match but I mean are you still confident the team can get a get a result here yeah I think we always confident at home I think regardless of the opponent we have to be our best selves and we have to learn lessons from previous games always and continue to involve and improve and I think very recently we beat Chelsea in the cup we beat Arsenal at home so there's absolutely no reason why we can't um continue that positive run we have to view the game for what it is we have to as I say nullify their threats we have to be strong defensively but we have to bring our strengths as well and our strengths are unique to us when we're playing well I think we're a great sight in attack and we want to see that attack football um flowing again and and just on the FA Cup draw I mean any thoughts on that I mean obviously Bromley at home managed by a former goalkeeping coach at the club do you have any of thoughts as to to what that might be might be like for him well yeah I was watching the the draw yesterday and uh naturally like every Newcastle fan I'm sure hoping for a home draw and we got that which has been rare and rare Supply uh for us over the last couple of Seasons so it was great to see and yeah I think there's a nice link back there to Newcastle so um that'll be a great occasion but we look forward to that when it comes around thanks thank you Andy on H you said on on Saturday it was difficult to answer the questions about the goal scoring form Etc I just wondered you were talking to Raza there about how you've watched it back it's been kind of replaying back those last couple of minutes in particular are you any closer do you think to establishing one straight and is there one answer for it or not well it' be beneficial to play with a A Center forward any team and I think we've had that issue before this season so with Alex's injury that that definitely disrupted our our Rhythm um but we that wasn't our only issue I think we had a couple of other issues as well which of course we're when you analyze the game and you're looking to then move forward you make the tweaks to the team and you hope that it works and I think I I said after the game on Saturday goal scoring has never historically been a problem for my teams it's usually been the other way where we've been very front fo very attack-minded certainly there's been no change in our approach we're still very front foot we're still very attack-minded but some things these things just happen and they go in phases um that doesn't mean we're neglecting the fact that we're uh where we are and we're not it's obvious we're not attacking in the fluent way that we were so we just have to give the players confidence and we have you know we've got some outstanding technical attacking players some brilliant 1 V1 players we need to give them the license and the freedom to do that and hope the confidence floods back at times like this I know you get the training ground a ridiculously early hour anyway but do you Dej to do the rest of the coaches do you kind of put any extra work into it or not we're getting even earlier and uh no uh no I think it's about giving the players confidence genuinely I think it's about creating the environment and the culture that that they're comfortable and free and then you'll see the best of of our players as I said I've got no doubting their qualities to making them feel good and giving them the right structure to um to show those qualities but it's not just about the attackers and I think the the immediate Focus will always be on them but it's about the team creating chances for them and that includes the goalkeeper that includes Center halves fullbacks um we all attack together we defend together so it's about the whole team playing in unison um to do that you've got to have um the right feel I think only one team in Premier league history has had a bigger lead at this stage of the Season than Liverpool have are they Prem PR League winners this season have they already Champions elect do you think in the sense that they've been already tered no I I think nothing's ever secure or done until it's done and I think um the Premier League is known for twists and turns so who knows what's going to happen um I think all we can do is control our part and certainly our season is yet to be sort of set in terms of what's going to happen we've been inconsistent we've had highs and lows uh for us it's about trying to continue to make more highs on a consistent basis that's what we're trying to do just one final one on a more lighthearted note I don't know if you're saying but Bruno's yet to win a a coin toss at St james' park at home uh have you seen that and is tomorrow night the night that he finally wins one at St James I'm sort of aware of it when obviously the I won't necessarily describe it too much what happens uh at that moment and yeah it's one of those things I mean surely LW of averages says he's going to win one soon thanks Edie Al back hi Eddie um you some of your best performances have come against bigname opposition do you think do you know why that might be or and is this an opportunity to uh to perform again sen as you playing Liverpool um yeah no I wouldn't disagree with that I think that's a fair assessment I think we have to it's easy for us to say when you're preparing a game treat every opposition the same and try and have the same Focus for every opposition of course that that's our aim we don't treat anyone any differently um we and certainly Our intention is to attack in a consistent way regardless of who we're playing but every game is different and the challenge is different and the the atmosphere is different the feels different um so it's up to us to create that that flow in our game and sometimes that can come from a defensive action or a defensive moment that inspires us with the ball so um I think as long as everyone's together focusing on a really good performance we'd be fine how's um Kieran trippier getting on is his is his Fitness at a level where he can start because he helped create a lot of chances last season didn't he and you were talking about the whole team being part of that attacking play so are you missing that influence yeah absolutely I mean trips in line with the other players on that right hand side created so much for us historically I think if you go back to our Champions League season that was probably our most dominant side of the pitch um a lot of goals came from that side a lot of chances were created down that side and Kieran was pivotal to that so we've certainly missed his attacking attributes and his range and and what he brings uh he's improving I'd say physically I I think he's been out he hasn't really played consistently now for quite a long time so I think getting him back in that Rhythm where he can um feel 100% fit will take a little bit of time um but he's certainly closer than he was and uh touch Wood's uh solv the hamstring issue that he had initially with him unavailable and with Murphy not playing as much as he did maybe last season and isach and Wilson not always fit are you having to find new ways of playing new ways of tackling these problems yeah I think we're finding trying to find new Solutions um which always happens and the team always evolves what I think it's very rare that you look back two years and the team's the same as it was two years ago with the same Partnerships and the same uh players playing in those positions because the game evolves you evolve oppositions evolve um so yes we are trying to find um I say Solutions but we're trying to build new relationships between players and that sometimes takes a little bit of time to get the feel between each other and you can see from the team in recent weeks there's been little tweaks positional tweaks because we're trying to find a way to make us more creative um and obviously create more goal scoring opportunities thank you thanks alist Danny Eddie a few weeks ago when there was a about contracts you said at the time that even your big players had to be doing it on the pitch to to earn those contracts and to stay in the team but at the moment have you got the strength in depth to be able to reinforce that yeah no I think there is strength in depth maybe not in every position but certainly in some key positions I think there is um certainly with callum's return once Callum gets up to full speed which hopefully uh will happen in the next few weeks he'll add another dimension um and then we've got other players coming back and the not too distant future like Sven botman adds unbelievable strength to our Squad there a big difference maker along with Jamal who would be a little bit further back so I think we're slowly getting there in terms of competition for places and strength and depth but as I said I don't think that runs through the whole Squad um but that will take some time and and in those positions that you don't have that strength in depth does that strengthen your hand going into January when you you go to the the people above you and say this is what I would like I think that's a different question I think that's a totally different subject January and and targets and what areas of the squad would look to strengthen because it's not clearcut what we will be able to do what we won't be able to do um so we'll wait and see on that one you go to Jordan and then Lee morning morning when you look at the Premier League table I think with the excep a lot of teams struggled for consistency why is your team struggle for consistency this season well yeah again that's not a clear one word one sentence answer I think the Premier League this year is very very um even in terms of quality I think there's a lot of teams that are very strong um I think maybe in previous years there's been a bigger gap between the the top teams and the other teams and um you've seen that Gap in terms of The League table but this year it's very congested very tight and we form Part of That League at the moment where we're we're not being consistent enough to take ourselves away from the other teams um and we have to try and find the right solutions to um find the key to to find those consistent results for us um I think it says a lot about the strength of the league um then you know you might come up with a whole host of arguments as to why the League's so tight this year I'm not going to sit here and do that but we have to focus on ourselves and make sure that we're harder to beat um we're scoring more goals we're attacking and defending better as a group all these things we're working on on a daily basis are you confident the consistency will come back in this so why why is that well I was confident that the start of the Season our performances our general performances would improve from a low start Point um for all the reasons that we've discussed in previous press conferences I'm still anticipating that will continue and we'll refind our missing part of our game which is the most important part and is the hardest part the goal scoring the goal creativity that is not to be taken for granted it's something that you have to really work towards I think we've got the players to do it I've got no doubt we'll refine that once we do I think then we a totally different team because I think the positive news from our starts of the season is that we've been good defensively in the main we've looked solid um in the main we've been hard to score against and we haven't been perfect in that respect but that gives us a great start point and a great Foundation to build from um if we can refind our goal scoring touch which we had for the majority of my time here got some lead and Luke more n um on the Tactical side of it do you feel like just some have to go back to basics and potentially just get a what would be a good solid point from this game and maybe sort of drop the attacking uh principles sometimes no no I don't for me attacking is that's a cliche I I won't use that one um Daman knew where I was going with it um no for me attacking is fundamental it's it's your it's your aim in the game you're giving the players a purpose and we will always attack I make no apologies for that um I'd rather not be in the job than not fulfill that promise to the supporters we want to entertain ultimately we want to play attacking football that the Newcastle supporters can't wait to see I know we're not delivering that at the moment and that's a frustration so no we're not going to drop that we just got to become better at it you mentioned the the confidence or lack of confidence whatever it is um is that a deeper problem or is it just one of them sort of Da things in football where someone just scores from a yard out and it just changes it and it goes you other direction very quickly yeah I me possibly I I think it's sometimes it's just a state you can get into a flow when you're doing when you're playing well you don't even think about it you just attack and and we've done that for the majority of my time here as I said I look at some of the performances some of the goals some of the the general play that we've delivered and it's it's a it's a beautiful thing and sometimes when that's not clicking it can look a little bit robotic and look a little bit forced um but the most important thing is that from my side at this moment in time I back the players I know their qualities I want them to go on the pitch free not overthinking playing the game that they've always loved and I think if we do those key things the goals return just on Callum Wilson obviously you've got to be very careful with him as you say um he didn't look too happy when he didn't come on earlier in the game I suppose that's got to be a good sign because you want players who are desperate to to do a job for you yeah I mean I think the key thing for me is that we try as best we can is to keep Callum fit for as long as possible so he can get in his flow and his rhythm that's not going to come back um instantly um he's done very limited training with us um I think it would have been really foolish of me to put them on the pitch the other day as much as I wanted to so it's about trying to give him the best chance to stay fit all season thanks Craig morning Eddie you you said there it's not clear what you can and can't do in January but do the hierarchy have to find a way however that is to help you guys it's two windows in a row now without even really attempting to improve the start in the 11 do the players on the inside feel that because there's nothing like a fresh p not just add quality but to bring more out of everybody else and even you as well do you need help in January I think there's a desire from everyone at the club to to deliver that I think then you have to go to the realities of what is possible and you have to make decisions always as you'll understand for the here and now but also for the future and we have to make sure that we don't put ourselves in a position where the some of them becomes very very difficult to do what we need to do or future Windows Beyond so yeah I think freshness is important in a squad I'm not going to sit here and deny that I think there needs to be a certain element of trading in and out to keep the group dynamic new because a new Dynamic and a new team always has to form I think every season I think sometimes the same Squad can produce a staleness can produce a negative product so I think we're aware of that um but it's all what we're able to do rather than I want I want is clear but it's what we're able to do I think is the key thing can I just ask on Anthony Gordon as well left Winger right winger Center forward what does he want what do you want and what is best for the team well I think it is about the team it's not necessarily what Anthony wants what I want I think it's what the team needs I think that's always been my thought players have to play where the team needs them to play now Anthony yes he's been moved to a degree um but he has played a lot of games in his favored position I've always said that's hisor position I got no problem saying that um and it's up to him to perform in that position when he plays there he's played on the right and he's played well he created the goal against Arsenal not so long ago and probably possibly in that moment people were saying well that's his position on the right it's never clearcut good players can play in loads of different positions as it's been proved to me many times but it's about your attitude when you play in that position has to be um of the best level and I have to say from Anthony's perspective playing up front again on Saturday I he did really well and his attitude to that was excellent than great Luke um just picking up on something Craig said there by every metric um every team needs their best players to be playing well consistently by every metric Bruno isach and Gordon are way down on where they were last season is that a concern for you um without talking about individual players I think I would agree you need your best players performing at their best levels that would naturally especially if they're in the attacking areas of the pitch transform your your delivery I think they are without doubt outstanding players um I think it's my job to try and create always the right environment for them to produce their best football um I've had several meetings with all of the players not just the names you've mentioned to try and get them at their best levels to try and um solve little issues that we may have to propel the team forwards I'll continue to do that I continue to invest every hour that I can to to help the team to help the players but it's never as clearcut or as simple as people may think from the outside um we have had a lot of issues this summer um and continue to have them this season where we're not quite um our best um but I'm pretty sure with one or two moment that can easily change and the dynamic can look very different um I think from my perspective along with the players give me everything that they've got and I think those players um have by and large given me everything um then I'm sure we'll be fine um whenever there's a runner slightly disappointing results at Newcastle there tends to be criticism of the manager how are you finding it this season and what is your response to that criticism for example that you need to change system that teams have worked out how to play against you yeah I think I've got no doubt that criticism is out there I think it's out there all the time to be honest I don't think it's whether you're win losing or drawing of course it will be magnified I think if you're not performing at your best but I think it goes with the job I've said many times I've got no issue with it you expect it you understand it you live with it um it doesn't really change anything that I do I me constantly analyzing the team to see if we need to tweak things to change things to if anyone thinks I'm sat there G we're just going to do the same thing week in week out you know that's nothing could be further from the truth you got to be very careful that changes you make benefit you then they don't um hurt you even more so I'm sort of very much living in that world where you've got to stick to I think the things that work and just try and tweak the things that aren't thanks L got a few to get through got five minutes remaining got to George Dominic Kieran then Martin hi Eddie hior when you talk about inconsistency has there been an inconsistency to attitude as well as to Performance do you think uh no I'm thinking deeply because I want to give you an honest answer no I I think the body language of the team the attitude of the team by and large I think's been very good and I think there's always going to be moments in the season where that can be challenged and and I would and I have always give honest feedback to the players when I think it's been good and when I think it hasn't been quite right I think in the main it's it's been there positively there's been moments absolutely there's been moments where I've had to make it very clear what's acceptable and what's not um and that can always change you can have a brilliant sort of example positively and the next week it can for whatever reason with individuals or within the group can just s suddenly go down so certainly something for me to be aware of because I think that representation attitude is the best and the most important thing that we need to bring on a consistent basis thanks George Don just on Bruno one change you did make ahead of the season was making him Captain how do you think he's handled that and do you expect or do you want him to be Captain for for years to come yeah I think it's been a positive thing for Bruno um I think he's really embraced it behind the scenes I think he's been very good um his conduct on and off the pitch has been on a really high level I think naturally Through Time his leadership skills will will develop I think that's that's only natural for someone who's Captain for this club for the first time um and that's a new Dynamic for him amongst the players but I couldn't be happier with how he's embraced it how he's attacked it um yeah and I'm sure he'll grow from this point onwards K he um you mentioned the word stale earlier I mean is that your biggest fear that that could happen here I mean how do you prevent that I think yeah I mentioned that in a relation to a question of course [Music] um yeah obviously mentioning that in relation to the transfer window and the fact that we we haven't had a huge turnover of players and I think that's as I said earlier that's a a slight concern there's always concerns in two ways if you bring too many players in you can have a that can have a negative impact in terms of upheaval of the team and relationships aren't forming and vice versa the other way so I think you can keep that stess away in various ways obviously Innovation from us in terms of the team training everything loads of team building stuff and and different things you can do to make sure the players aren't coming into the same environment and you finished above Liverpool two seasons ago how difficult in a PSR world is it for teams like you ason bille this season when you get there to actually stay there that's the challenge for us and it is it isn't easy as you say under a PSR world it's everything is different and will continue to be different for a period of time for us so it's about being as smart as we can with anything that we do do thanks K Martin to finish H along along those lines Ed has it been difficult when you weren't able to strengthen the last two windows uh yeah I think that that of course there was a want from us to do to do so um especially in the summer uh where we saw that was a a couple of players that we felt could have made a difference in different positions but yeah it didn't happen and the other side is we lost although we' never had um yanuba M we lost with him and Elliot two key players for us and so it's not just a sort of the lack of incomings it's losing two talented young guys as well so but that goes with the territory and we just have to adapt to make the best of the situation and I still believe in the squad we have the squad we have is a very good squad it's our job to do better with it and finally is the not scoring worrying you is it something you take home with you you always take it home with you I can't lie and say I close the door and everything's forgotten and then I step out and no you live it every second you take it of course you take it home with you um but I'm confident in the players I'm confident in our method of work I've got no doubts we will refin our touch
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,4gFPMSuyAck,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gFPMSuyAck,good morning I'm being Razer for the day um happy birthday as well thank you very much um You probably don't want to talk about it too much but just a quick one on on West Ham on Monday because you talked about it immediately after the game as being a disjointed performance for a number of different reasons just now that you've had three or four days to think about what those reasons were what what more have you gleaned in the last few days I think I said disjointed last half an hour um I thought the the first 60 Minutes was pretty good um had no complaints with the performance had complaints with not taking our chances and the goals we conceded the last half an hour wasn't great I think we had a couple of injuries um players playing out of position and it showed um talking of injuries Bruno and and Jo look the two obvious ones how are they and How likely are they to play a part tomorrow they have a chance to play um not serious injuries so uh we'll make a decision today Monday night is probably the strongest Squad you've had available for a little while and and if those two are available and Dan burn coming back as well from suspension gives you the kind of selection dilemma that you probably want to have it's a nice position to be in yeah it's I think it's a position that we weren't in at all last season um or maybe at the start of the Season we were but very quickly those decisions ebed away with the huge amount of injuries we had um certainly you want that Squad depth especially in this month coming up I think December is going to be crucial for us you see the fixture list we have a lot of games an intense period and you want that choice and we're going to need that because um naturally we're going to pick up injuries um along the way does that feed into your selection tomorrow but also the way you approach tomorrow's game the fact that you've got Liverpool Wednesday Brent for the following weekend or not um year to a point of course you have to look ahead we're well aware of what we have on the horizon and you there's certain players that I think we will have to manage during that period but the focus is always on the next game and it's always on trying to win the next game and that always takes priority so sort of a balancing app between the two and just finally from you one on Palace their second bot of but that's probably not a reflection on it's a reflection on how they've played but it's not a reflection on how dangerous they can be tomorrow yeah I think I think you're right I don't think it's a reflection on the strength that they have and how they play and certainly soor Spark's always a difficult ground to go to so um I look back at the win against Tottenham I thought they played really well and I think their recent results have SE seen an upturn in performances um and and results I think they've um been much um uh more competitive in the last few games and they'll always be competitive because that's the nature of the club that they are so we go there knowing tough game tough fixture um but we back ourselves always if we're our best thank you very much K SKS happy birthday Eddie thank you um have you been able to celebrate after Monday I guess celebrations tempered slightly after the the week would you say slightly fully I [Laughter] think no it's been a normal day for me I'm up early in here um um preparing the game and I I think um I've learned in this job that family things always take a back seat to the job um fully focused on the game and making sure that we're as well prepared as we can be you're always very measured um pre and and postmatch after a result like that when I think everyone would have expected a win yourself included do you read the riot act to the the players at all or you measure the way you look at it uh firstly I think from a personal Viewpoint you can never underestimate the opposition we certainly didn't with West Ham we had a long time to prepare the game and as I said for the first 60 Minutes although we were 2-0 down um I thought the performance was pretty good and I think if we get that first goal I thought it was a really good feel and energy in the stadium early on and if we get that first goal the result is obviously very different we didn't we conceded I think the goal affected us for 10 minutes then we recovered played very well again and then the second goal flawed us and that was disappointing really the reaction to the second goal in particular as I said the last half an hour wasn't great so I think you you always look at the first thing is the attitude of the players how was our um intent body language all the key Clues really to how the players um mentally are going into the game and I thought we were we were pretty good so there was no right attack but there was a lot of reflection a lot of analysis and a lot of work done on the training ground since you've used the word consistency in here the last couple of weeks and you've apologized for it both times you've used it because you've said I'm sorry it's a boring word but why do you feel this season you're finding that word difficult to come by yes um consistency of results definitely I think consistency of results is is a very difficult thing to get I think consistency of performances is a thing that we're looking for and I think it it's been much better since the open few games I think we have performed um pretty well not at our best levels but pretty well for a sustained period of time um I think that's the Premier League this year and I don't know why that is but there's a lot of results and consistent results that's reflected in the league table being so congested and tight um apart from Liverpool I don't think anyone would probably say that they've been um necessarily where they want to be I think that's a challenge for all of us and that's the competitivness of the league and certainly games and seasons are defined by the next one coming up Crystal Palace as I've said always traditionally a very difficult fixture they've got very good players an outstanding manager so um this is another test of our mentality on the positive side of things um I know we've spoken about a lot in press conferences I thought the um I don't know if you agreed with me but I thought the war flag's display for um Alex isack before the game was as good as we've seen um I guess he's frustrated that he wasn't able to pay the fans back on the on the night for that and and is he desperate just to sort of get back get scoring and and doing what he does best yeah it wasn't for the one to trying I think he had six seven shots in the game so I think he was definitely a goal threat um unfortunately the best finish he delivered was the one that was just marginally offside um but yeah as I said wasn't for the want to trying I thought his his work rate his physical figures and numbers were very very good um it just wasn't to be in front of goal for him and the team but he's been in really good form lately and I thought it overall it was a good performance from Alex and again the demand from the team is that we Supply him as much as we can because we know with him and Callum and will we've got three really good dangerous Strikers thanks Andy well Edie uh Happy Birthday do you feel 47 and uh what sort of presence do the family actually get Eddie how on his birthday uh do I feel 47 sometimes when I wake up I feel older than 47 when I get out of bed the body's taken a bit of a hammering in my life um number of injuries over the years mentally I feel good I feel younger than 47 um but you'll tell me how I look I'm not going there oh okay thought you might say how I've looked after myself facially okay thank you um presence wise no I haven't had anything so it will be a later date when the game's out the way get the game out of the way first um just one on one day St James's part I think the word was frustration around St james' part have you felt that frustration from the players on the training ground this week and if so how have you seen that frustration on the training ground this week um I wouldn't say necessarily I've seen the frustration I think you see the hurt in and around the changing room after the game you want that hurt you want the players to feel as disappointed as we all felt supporters included but then you want to see the reaction in the right way so not necessarily showing outwards but in the training in the attitude to the training in the in the detail of our work in the um the focus in training for the next game and I think we've seen that I don't think we have an issue with Attitude within the group we've got very um professional group of players but we need to find the solutions internally together and push forward and try and go on the run that we need to I suppose one of the plus points was Callum Wilson coming back from injury obviously he's had such a difficult time it so personally rather than professionally you you've known Callum for many many years how much has he had to deal with but also from a mentality perspective is he one of the strongest players you've ever come across to kind of have to deal with all these setbacks and still come through it and still keep coming back for more I guess yeah it is difficult because naturally every Sportsman wants to be able to execute what they're what they're paid to do and what they love to do and I think Callum is one of those players that anyone that knows him and seen him work loves to score goals lives to score goals in training and um it's just a brilliant mentality to that and when you're not able to do that because of your body it's a hugely frustrating thing and he's had setbacks and various challenges but he always comes in with a smile on his face he always comes in in a positive mood and I got no doubt sometimes he's coming in in that with that attitude not feeling that way but he's almost acting to a degree because he knows the power of His personality within the squad I can't speak highly enough of how he's faced his challenges in his career and this is a big moment for him now because he wants to stay fit we need him to stay fit from our Viewpoint because we know what quality ities he has both on and off the pitch he's a huge personality just finally Crystal Palace I know you talk about it being a tough game against tough opposition and SOS Park been a tough place to go what is the biggest challenge of going to a place like SOS Park well I think for us recently it will be starting the game well um and trying to impose ourselves on them I think controlling the crowd um all all these things and this is sort of and pace for any away game because every away game brings its unique challenges so we know what to expect we've been there many times um but we certainly know that they're a very dangerous team and we don't underestimate them thanks Andy Nisha morning Eddie morning just following on from Andy's question about Callum Wilson how is he feeling physically after coming and playing on the pitch again yeah I think he felt fine um he trained yesterday so you know a good response to to the game and the demands of the game because he hasn't had a a huge body of training he's been away and he's done a lot of work um mainly away from the training ground with various specialist but he came back in and um yeah had a big bounce in his step yesterday and uh fingers crossed will be the same today you have um Fabian Shar and Joe Linton close to suspensions with yellow cards have you spoken to them about that because you do have this congested fixture list coming up uh it's a difficult one to to go into too much detail on that you know with the players because they need to be free Joey needs to be free to play his game he's biggest strength or one of his biggest strengths is his ability to win the ball and to to cover every blade of grass and to be physical with his opponent part of the reason I withdrew him on uh Monday was to make sure we had him for the next game because um he is such a pivotal figure for us um so yeah with those guys I think the likelihood is they will get booked before the the cut off point but that's why we have the squad and just finally after a disappointing home game do you take some heart going into the palace game knowing that the away form has improved of late yeah I think we have to be positive in every respect the league still so tight um again consecutive Wings can Elevate you our last away performance was very strong um I see no reason why we can't deliver that kind of performance again um we respect every game we don't take our foot off the pedal in respects of our preparation and making sure that the players are absolutely focused on what they need to deliver and it's up to us to do that thank you thanks daa got to Daman D le Ryder morning Eddie hi Dam nothing wrong with 47 by the way or 57 um just check exactly what Joe Will's injury was please Joe took a a bang a nasty whack trying to block a shot I think um just above the ankle so he lost a little bit of feeling in his leg I went a bit numb for a while but uh yeah it looks like he uh has improved quickly um just on on Callum is Alex isak's form has perhaps been at his best during his time here when callum's been fitting and pushing him how important is callum's Fitness in terms of not only what he provides but the effect it might have on Alex yeah I do I do think there's probably something in that I think psychologically when you know you've got a player of callum's quality and Alex's quality fighting each other for the shirt I think naturally that can only um increase your awareness really of your performance and making sure that you stay absolutely on top of yourself they're two real competitors are very different in their games but two absolute Fighters that both want to play um which is a great thing for me to have um I'd love to have the opportunity to work with them both for a sustain period of time because I think they add so much to the team thanks te Lee on on Bruno how how's he doing physically and I guess sort mentally after a disappointing night from the other night um I think mentally Bruno's been really strong this year and and previous Seasons I think he's had a lot to cope with he's of course you can never underestimate the impact playing for a country like Brazil has on any athlete I think it's intense pressure for him a lot of travel and of course he comes back here and he's Captain here so he's got a big Dem on him but I think he's he's relished that demand and I think he is's embracing it but it's slightly different for him so I think there's a period of adjustment for him um and games like Monday are a great test for that leadership and a great test for him and his resilience really to to come back after disappointments and to not just think of yourself but to think of the group and the squad ahead of yourself so really good challenges for Bruno and um physically he felt he felt um a muscle problem um but fingers crossed he's again he's another one that's improving quickly so we'll see just on leis meley he's obviously had a great run last year I mean do you have to explain to him that it's not always going to be like that or will he get another run this season I've got no doubt he'll get a run at some stage during this season I think the big thing for Louie is um that he's still very early back from his injury and we need to give him games so tonight we'll touch with everything being well and everyone comes through training today there's an opportunity for him to play games and get his rhythm back um with the development Squad and obviously I guess you're going to get asked about Mark gu at some point a player that was linked heavily here last summer um what what you sort of what's your feelings going into the game going up against him now because you're going to know his strengths and weaknesses better than most managers I guess what I'd like to think that we know about everyone strengths and weaknesses regardless of you know the player and the opponent I think um it's very difficult to comment too deeply look Mark's someone we respect and um he's a very good player thanks uh goes Craig Aaron and then Jordan morning Eddie uh Sandra Tali hasn't been in the team since his performance against Chelsea the last three where is Sandro at how has he dealt with that and how does he get back in the team Sandro has been good yeah I think he's trained really well um especially this week I've been really pleased with his contribution I think he did really well when he came out against Notting Forest as well in in a moment where I think that game was in the balance I think it was one all when he entered the pitch and I thought he really played a big part in moving that game towards us so he's fighting for a place uh and he's doing himself no harm with how he's performing in training there's a lot of debate as to Bruno and Sandro together now they can obviously play together but can they start together at the moment anything is possible Craig um of course they can they're two outstanding players it's up to me to try and find a solution that works for both players and sees their their qualities within the team because I think you can put any player into the team and any combination of players into the team but it's got to be to the team's benefit it's got to be right for both players to Showcase their attributes so um hopefully we can do that thanks CRA Aron morning Eddie um just another one on Callum obviously not playing for so long there's naturally a lot of outside noise about his future it sounds like from your previous anwers he's dealt with that outside noise really well I think as a modern day player now you have to I think if you don't deal with outside noise and you let it affect you and let it creep into your thoughts that can be a very dangerous thing so I think one of the challenges for any modern day player Young player coming through is the ability to ignore everything apart from obviously the information that you need from people that you respect and have got your best interests at heart so I think that's a new thing that modern players are adjusting to because the noise and social media and other uh Avenues can be really loud so if the players sort of took that information on and believed most of it none of them would be had to kick a ball so I think callum's experienced enough to know that and um as R single-minded in his pursuit of what he wants and that's one of the the biggest qualities he has and obviously Callum coming back might mean less minutes for willisa how's he been since he signed in the summer and how much progress have you seen from him behind the scenes yeah and interesting question because I think Will's been excellent um behind the scenes I think there's always um a processor player has to go through especially when they sign um as in Will's case so young um with a lot of work ahead of him to get to be the player that he eventually wants to be but he's really committed to that work I have to say he's been excellent he's really um embraced the coaching side of our work um he's worked really closely with Graham Jones um with myself with Jason with Steven Simon with you know different play people at different times and I think we've seen a real growth in his performance now he's competing against two outstanding experienced Center forwards um but he's got a big part in our future ahead I think thanks we got Jordan and dum and DW Jordan morning happy happy birthday thank you um just onjul he start the last four games in the wide areas obviously both three wins before you National break a defeat on Monday does that defeat on Monday change you're thinking in terms of his position or do you still see him as a wide forward best for the team I see him as everything really I don't think it's I've said many times here I think it's difficult to Define what his best position is and I think with Joe he's very keen to do what's best for the team I think I have to look at it on a game by game basis and see where we feel we need him for this particular game um he's got qualities in every position um I love him in Midfield and I love him wide as well um but we yeah we we'll continue to utilize him in different positions as long as it's not to a detriment of his overall performance but again against West Ham I thought he was very good for the the time that he played and on Monday Fabian Sher made his 200 pns for Newcastle and in a social media post after the game he said he has to many more um I think he's out of contract the end of the season would you like him to stay in is that a hint that them might be a new deal in the offen well yeah I think with Fabby I think he's just speaking on my behalf he's been incredible for me I have to say he's been absolutely Sensational with some of the performances that he's delivered he's an integral part of what we're doing um his use of the ball I think is well known his technical qualities but not only that how he's defended um has been very very strong for us so um yes he's a an important player and we'd love to keep him Dominic morning Eddie happy bir birthday thank you um you haven't won a Premier League game with without Bruno in the squad since since he signed for the club how important is that you find a way to to manage manage these games it's not a great stat no I'm just trying to think how many games that would have been but um it's seven so how how do you find a way is that with him not in the sorry I've got to ask a bit more is that with him not in the 18 when he's not played yeah when he's not played okay how do you find a way to win without him in well hopefully we don't have to figure that out I don't know because he's in the team so let's just keep him there for now okay and H Louis Miley with the 21s tonight as you expect does that effectively he won travel to palis um at the moment as I said we got to train first so let's see how we get through training but the plan is that I feel Louie needs to play he was injured for a period of time and games were doing the world of good um rather than traveling with us thanks Tom Tom Shaw Heidi just on callum's contract um can that be an extra incentive to him coming back now I think callum's got loads of incentives internally built within him um I wouldn't necessarily have to ask him about those I know what those are he's got he's a very driven person and he does regularly set himself goals so I'm sure his contract will be on his mind but I think it'll probably be at the back part of his brain because he'll be focusing on the here and now and doing things that can affect his long-term future for the positive you mentioned the congested nature of the League this year does that present you with a unique opportunity well it does because we know that if we can be consistent there's every chance that we can um have a great season but the frustration for me looking at Monday night was a massive opportunity missed and we can't keep missing those when they arrive because they won't be there forever so um yes the league is tight and it does give everyone in the league an opportunity if you can um find that level of form that we're all after
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,nLNj9LgOlYs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLNj9LgOlYs,good morning morning uh how was your trip to Saudi Arabia last weekend it was good it was uh a long flight um but the weather was really good for us um it was nice to spend some time with the group uh three intense days I think the you know the players worked hard um both training wise and sort of commercially but a sort of a whirlwind trip but good to be back as well and um some good training here here too and because you've got the match now on Monday night having been moved and with the two-e break have you been able to give the players decent amount of time off as well those that haven't been on International Duty yeah initially after The nottingam Forest game they had a few days with their families um so I think the sort of gap between games was longer than maybe we would want um but I think we've been able to use the time wisely want to ask you about a couple of players who've been out injured firstly Callum Wilson um what are the prospects for him regarding the West Ham match do you expect to have him back um he's doing well um we anticipate he's going to train with the group today whether he's quite there for West Ham let's see there's a chance there's a there's a chance he could be involved but we need to get through the next few days in training first we know you have to be very careful with him and you won't take any risks but how frustrating is this because obviously you'd have hoped to have had him back before now now and there's still potentially a chance it may go on for longer yeah but I think that the most important thing is that Callum does come back and when he does come back he's in a in a good place to contribute and to make a difference um we know his importance for for a host of reasons as I've been through many times before obviously at a delicate stage of his uh return because we've got to manage the last Parts correctly I'm such a valuable player um but we need to learn from previous um issues that we've had and try and keep him on the pitch and what about Kieran trippier who you been without for a number of weeks is he close to returning yeah slightly closer I'd say uh than cumy trained yesterday trained well felt good um no ill effects look sharp but that was his first day's training so again we're in a similar position in the respect that right at the end of the rehab youve got to navigate the last few days well you mentioned it a few minutes ago about the gap between matches probably being longer than you would have liked is it frustrating having to play last again like you did before the international break or can it be a good thing because your international players can at least have a little bit longer with you to prepare yeah there's two sides I think to that coin because I think you've got the international players who benefit from the longer gap um especially players like Bruno and migy who have had long flights they've played games so they will benefit from it the the players that have remained with us probably itching to play and and probably need to play quite quick quickly West Ham at home what do you remember about the match last season which was really key wasn't it in helping you finish the season strongly yeah it was it was a for the neutral that would have been a brilliant game for for both probably coaching sides I think there was a lot to to analyze and take from it I think the most important thing for us from a really difficult position we showed that spirit that we've always had that you're never out of a game we're one or two moments away from igniting something that can change momentum at home and um I think that's a great feeling to know that you've got the power of the supporters when you score in those moments and you're trailing a game that you get that feeling that The Comebacks on and once we had that momentum I think we were difficult to stop um one of those games that will always live long in the memories I think um but I think for us as the case this is a totally different game different manager of course at West Ham um I think they've recruited well in the summer so it's going to be a a challenging game for us and I think we're keen to keep our momentum three three big wins before the break U and we're desperate to keep that run going thanks R Cas morning Edy morning did you I'm guessing you watched the the England game potentially as a as a as a group when you were over in in sday the weekend and did you watch on with pride at three of your your players in the starting 11 yeah we did we we sat down with um I'm just trying to remember about it was with with the staff the whole staff um sat and watched the game together at the hotel that we were in in in Saudi and um yeah there was an enormous amount of pride I think between the staff watching The Players perform and not just performed but how well they performed as well in the game and how they contributed to England's win I think it was a great thing to see and great to see Anthony score his first goal and Tino win his first cap and Lewis Hall in his second game look so settled in the in the team so full credit to all of the players that have made um those big strides in their careers um moments for them they'll never forget they'll always look back with pride you know in those first few moments for their country I think it's almost 30 years since the last time three Newcastle players were in the starting lineup of an of an England side and it's three players that I know you want won't want to take credit for it but three players that you've brought to the the club yourself and that you've developed so that must be a nice feeling yeah I mean it's a nice feeling for the players really my my thoughts and emotions always go to them I've seen parts of their journey of course see in all of it you know you go back and I've got a close relationship with the players so we speak about their history and their past and what it's taken to get to this point even to be a professional footballer a lot of sacrifices um not just for them but their families um these things don't happen by chance you need a team around you to support you and help you on your way and those players have had that foundation and that base mainly from their families as I say and that's why I think those moments are more collectively for them um but it's just great to share it and to see it and um of course then the challenge changes for them then it's about wanting more and making sure that they continue the positive momentum in their careers it feels like you have targeted young English Talent since you've become the the manager here I know you've you've signed Alex of Alexander isach and Bruno gim Etc but you have targeted young English talent to come in and improve your side and you've got a real core of that throughout your squad did moments like that on Sunday night kind of justify that that decision and that decision to recruit in that way um yeah I think for us there's always a balance in my opinion you need that balance in your recruitment it's not about targeting one specific area and say that that's where we're going to recruit from I think you need an open mind um I'm more than prepared to sign any type of player that we feel benefits the club for the position that we're looking to recruit in I think when you look solely at say Tino and Lewis two young backs fall into the same categories really in the sense that um developed in England um through the through the system developed really well by by Chelsea and we had an opportunity to sign them early um at different stages of their careers but for me two such Progressive players that will only get better hopefully with us with the right attitudes and the right technical base to to be exceptional players it was a really nice moment as well after Anthony's go when he he he celebrated with a sort of mini mini cartwheel um in tribute to I don't know if you saw it or aware of it I don't know if you've heard him speak about it since but um it was kind of in tribute to little girl Ivy who he went to to meet I think recently new Newcastle supporter um it kind of showed a lot about what was going through his mind at that time and I suppose the sort of character he is yeah I think didn't say it live I'd seen pictures of it photos of it so uh I'd be Keen to see it in in full motion but I think it does speak volumes because Anthony in that moment could have been very selfish and not selfish is the wrong word but very self motivated and thinking of himself but he's obviously had the the ability in that moment I mean scoring your first goal for the country is is something I can only imagine the feeling and emotions going through your body to think of someone else and pay tribute which is a great moment and just just finally from me see pep signed a agreed a new deal announced by Manchester City last night I guess for you guys making things even harder to try and get that elusive trophy yeah was delighted to see that um now on a serious note I think he's contributed so much to English football I think he's revolutionized really a lot of how a lot of teams play I think he's incredibly talented I think it's good for the English game that he's still here and he will continue to develop and evolve his style and people will continue to potentially follow that so I think um from that side great of course from the competition side it just keeps the Premier League for me the best league in the world than Andy on Ed Keith touched upon it there but the development of these players like Tino like Le like Anthony I suppose as well how much does it help you when it comes down to things like play negotiations when you can boast players that you have developed like Tino like Lewis like Anthony and they've gone and had milestones for England like they have yeah I mean I think you use anything that you can to highlight what the club can offer a potential signing or a potential renegotiation on a contract if you're trying to convince a player to stay so I think you use all the tools that you can and whether that's Player Development whether that's pathway opportunity um hopefully they're good cases for people to look back on and and to think well I could follow that same path every player is different every um situation is unique um but you know I've used those those moments before in a positive way to try and highlight what we can do for for players careers it went a little bit under radar I suppose with all of the F around Anthony scoring his first goal Louis antino as well but Louis Miley making his first start for the England under 21s which was great to see considering the injuries he's had over the last six months or so we haven't seen much of him naturally how developed do you think he is from the player that we saw burst onto the scene last season and the season before yeah I'd say his game will be of course developing every day and he'll be improving through training and through experience but I'd say his game was in a very good place at that stage yes he'll naturally improve um but I think the biggest development has come from him physically I think if you look at Louie when he first broke into the team you would see uh someone who was big for his age but maybe hadn't developed the the muscle without going too deep the muscle maybe definition that um that he has now and that's just through time and and age but he has worked really hard through his injury time to um develop his body to become more robust and he he looks just unbelievable athlete now I mean he's um belies his age really with how he looks um and and with how he plays and how he acts um to play for the England under 21s at at 18 years of age is a a testament really to how highly England regard him I think and of course how high we regard him as well so I think his career is in a good place we can just keep him fit we'll continue to develop him and I'm sure he'll play many times for us and speaking of Anthony I know you're a fan of I was listening to one of his interviews and he was talking about availability is the best ability uh how do you kind of rate that quote do you see that as a bit of a blueprint as the attitude of players under you yeah I think Anthony's always had that love for football he is desperate to play and train he he may get a knock or whatever situation he may have in in training and where other players may miss out he's determined to get on the pitch I think it's a great um mindset to have of course there's no guarantees in football football is such an unpredictable game and um I know he Treasures every day that he's available to play and I I do think it's a refreshing thing to see um and of course from our side we hope he stays fit and continues to contribute in the way that he has just looking at this season 18 points as a tally at the moment I think that's the same as the Champions League qualification season two behind where you were last season do you kind of look at that as a measuring stick to see how the side are doing or not our points yeah yeah absolutely I think it's the biggest indication of course it's not the only indicator of of how you're playing and lots of other things go into it but ultimately we have to be realistic you're judged on the points that you get so we're under no illusions on that um I am aware that we're in and around where we have been the last two seasons but I think in our Champions League season we from this point I think we ended up winning six games in a row which really propelled US during the middle part of the season to a great position of course we're all chasing that every team in the Premier League is chasing that now um for us the consistency and I know it's a boring word but it is key and if we can can continue where we left off from the last three games we're certainly in a good place just finally s fend has announced a couple of gigs at St james' Park next year Sur even ukas United manag to get a couple of tickets didn't he I didn't know that so that's that's good news um I'll certainly be putting a couple of requests in that's for sure thanks morning Eddie I know you mentioned that perhaps you wish there wasn't such a gap to the next game but is West Ham on a Monday night under the light St james' Park is that almost the perfect game back for you to pick up where you left off um I I think West Ham are a very good team and I think they've got a very good manager I think when you look at their recruitment in the summer I think there's always a a betting in period for new players I think they're going through that period now but I've got no doubt about the quality of players they've signed so now I think this is a tough game for us I think we back ourselves at home against anybody um I think we have to have that attitude and we had a very good record at St james' Park but there's there's no guarantees to any game we're going to have to earn the right to um perform or try and perform near our best and try and get the result and just one more um you mentioned Kieran trippier and K Wilson is there any other um injury news from Over the international break just em craft had an operation um um we anticipate he's going to be out for around six to eight weeks um so that's a big blow for us to lose ail who's been such a consistent performer so he will continue his rehab jamala Sal is and San botman are continuing on their respective paths so I think apart from that we're okay thanks start with Gary hiere what do you think refere should be gooded like as well um yeah I mean I think that's a contentious uh point of conversation at the moment for obvious reasons I think firstly our back the referees and and the whole structure and Howard web's handling of the situation um I'd be open to that if if that's where everyone wanted to go with it I would have no issues um with the is falling in line with the players in respect of of drug testing but it's not something that's on my immediate thoughts to be honest theall swed yeah I think he's he's building momentum into his season I think he's scored some big goals of late for us his General performances I think have continued to improve um he's gone away for Sweden he's played very well delighted with how he's how he's looked on International Duty as well to continue that good form I think being a striker having not been one myself but just from my experience it's all about confidence is always about how you feel um Alex has got undoubted qualities uh I would put him right up there in terms of world Strikers uh currently playing but I feel his potential is is great I think he can really um if he can continue on the path that he has been the last couple of Seasons continue to go um and prove himself as one of the world's best and that would be without putting pressure on him but that would be my target if I was him fin yeah well I think we're entering the business end in in the sense of December is always full of games uh full of big games for us full of opportunities that's how I see it for us to consolidate our position and continue to hopefully move into positive um territory but there's no guarantees we know how tight the Premier League is this year every game is difficult I'm under no Illusions there's no easy games home or away we don't underestimate anybody but we do back ourselves but yeah this is going to be a key point in our season thanks go to Rebecca then to Lee hi ready hi just wanted to ask is it quite a difficult time to be playing West Ham given the kind of patchy form that they're in at the minute yeah I mean I think it there they're always difficult games against West Ham and they always have been for us historically I think they're a team full of very good players I mean you look at their as again going back to their recruitment in the summer they recruited well um I think they've got a good squad they got some really dangerous players especially in the front line um obviously interesting watching Jared Bowen recently scor for England and he's always a goal threat um they've got some attacking players as I said that we respect and we're going to have to do well to get our structures right to to try and keep them quiet and just as well I just wanted to ask what you what you see Harvey barnes's role in the squad is just speaking before about that West Ham game obviously he's quite instrumental in it and he's also provided those late goals do you kind of see him as a bit of a super sub or is it just kind of hard at the minute for him to find a spot in the starting lineup with it being so strong and in form yeah I mean I certainly don't see him as a Super Sub although he has done really well from the bench for us and he's contributed goals assists I mean he was really the pivotal player in our comeback against West Ham last year and if he doesn't come on the pitch with the right attitude we don't win that game um but certainly he's more than that and he's capable of more than that and certainly I don't think Harvey would want that tag he's an outstanding player who's got a really good goal scoring record and a goal scoring um ability that he's always had in his career so I would love to try and find a way to get him work him into the team on a consistent basis that will be down to Harvey I think um if he continues to do well he's certainly knocking on the door to play regularly thank you got to Le Luke and Scott more ed morning just on selection do you know what your best 11 is yet or is that something that's just not in existence these days because of the Squad game yeah I don't think that is an existence I I don't think there's a definitive that is my best 11 and I think it does change because we've got top quality players and form fluctuates as well to a degree so you're always um taking each game on an individual basis trying to pick the right team for that respective game I think we've got a really good group of players and that best lineup or perceived best lineup could could change depending on form or Fitness and etc etc so that's a great position to be and I don't think I've been in that in my managerial career many times I think there's usually been a clear 11 I'm not sure that's the case this year just with a being Monday Night Football one of the the classic Newcastle games I don't know if you're aware of it was when Newcastle managed to produce 40 plus goal attempts in one game was T to Rob Le out the other day and uh just wondered if that sort of tally is even possible these days given the tactics of other teams um yeah I don't think we've hit that level since I've been here um it'll be nice to um we'd love a game like that but I think more often than not these days it's it's probably more half than than the 40 on on an average game I think we're we're averaging slightly less than that in terms of total shots in a game and I think we were last year I think we've been pretty consistent with that figure for the last couple of years um I think tactically now teams are very astute um a lot of teams defensive structures are very good as we hope our is it's tough to score in the Premier League um although the go tallies last year for us very high in the Prem Premier League in general are very high um the challenge is always to be a creative free flowing attacking team and that's what we're try to be because finally the the club um top brass have been talking about the stadium with the supporters and really good dialogue um and it was bought up that you know moving Stadium could double the revenue do you think the whole football World now has being almost educated with PSR and you know exactly what all that means uh yeah I think the revenue is key it is with the current rules as they stand everything that you do is defined by how much money you can bring in so I think it's taken on extra importance with the PSR rules as they currently stand um and of course that's why the club are looking at every Avenue to try and increase the money that we're bringing in thanks L Luke good morning be a bit SCA on this um it's unusual unusual yeah um you I think it's the first time since 1997 that you'd had threee England starters uh from Newcastle what does that say about where the club is in comparison to sort of its history really that was like a golden era 97 it must make incredibly proud um that the club has got itself back into that sort of position yeah I think we're proud of all our International Players regardless of what country they represent I think we we want to produce top players that can serve us well and of course then serve their respective countries well I think that's a big aim and push for us as coaches is to develop players now whether that means they end up as Internationals or they end up maximizing their own abilities whatever that may be that's what we'll try to do um but of course every time a player goes away and does well for his country we take um pride in that and we take a great deal of satisfaction that their careers are in a good place what does it say to potential signings that this is a club that you can grow and improve at yeah hopefully it does I mean that's a byproduct of that um the development of players is my big passion will always think be be there in my psyche um and yeah if that means other people look at that and think there's an opportunity if I go to Newcastle to improve my career then all well and good um don't take this the wrong way you've been on a really good run of form but have you had a problem against teams like West Ham at home I'm thinking you know Brighton this season Nottingham Forest last season Luton uh last season does that bring its own set of unique challenges that you've still got to master really well yeah navigating these games any game in the Premier League home or away is very difficult and you'll have different challenges so teams May set up in a particular way and you've got to try and find a solution to however they they set up um I don't think we have necessarily have a specific problem against a group of teams this is the Premier League and that's the competition is so high like the Brighton game for me we dominated most of the game we couldn't score we end up losing the game and um you have to accept that and then come back and find a way to to be better West Ham will be a very difficult game they got a very experienced manager who's managed at the very top of the game so no part of me thinks this game is going to be easy I'm sure the crowd will help us and support us as they always do we're going to need them massively in this match Scott hi Eddie um you touched on Callum there Eddie he's obviously out of contract at the end of the season now clearly he's got to get back he's got to be fit he's got to you know play some football if he can do that in the second half of the season and play a more prominent role is there a scenario where he can get a new deal and stay at this club of course there is I mean callum's got outstanding qualities and I I know everyone um in football has short memories but you look at what Callum has done since I've been here when he's been on the pitch he's been incredible um that Champions League season the way he and Alex dovetailed together to help each other and to help the team produce some brilliant performances and results was was brilliant to see now we've almost for a long period of time we've lost that ability to play them together or to help them share the load that's been a real frustration of mine and I know the players themselves My Wish for Callum is that he just gets gets back consistently fit and there's no doubting his qualities if he can and the future will take care of itself beyond that I don't necessarily get too bugged down or worried about that it's more just helping Callum in the short term and when Lee's talking about the stadium issues there and we kind of know a lot of the issues that are that are being wrestled with internally within the club a West Ham almost a perfect example of the pros and cons of it because they moved to that the new stadium bigger attendance bigger revenue and yet I think some West Ham fans will claim that the beding period was very difficult and they've maybe lost something from not being at Upton Park that they'll never get back that's the that's the two sides of it really in a nutshell isn't it well there's always two sides to to every story to every decision you have to make and the club will be no doubt going through an extensive process of knowledge debate um figures facts to try and reach the right decision and I played at Upton Park was lucky enough to play there it was a brilliant Stadium loved L playing there as an opposition player um a lot of history and you could feel the history every time you went there and the London Stadium is unique in itself I mean there's no other ground like that in the Premier League and it itself is a brilliant place to play it's just a very different experience uh no doubt we've got all those decisions to make as a football club and hopefully who whoever does make the decision makes the right one thanks Scott Joe you've been able to name a consistent sort of back five for the last few weeks obviously Dan Burns suspended for Monday night how much of a impact is that going to make on on what has been a solid unit over the last sort of six weeks or so yeah a blow to lose Dan because I think the defensive unit has as you say been in a good place in recent weeks um I thought Dan was very good against Nottingham Forest um I thought he individually um played very well defending crosses superbly um I think his aial ability and Mobility really helped us in the game so we're going to miss him and his leadership skills but it's an opportunity for someone else to come in and grab grab the opportunity um feel we have players that are waiting to play so um as much as we will miss down we always back the players that are going to come in just onson again he's got a brilliant record against West Ham during his career not just for Newcastle but for Bournemouth does that ever sort of come into your mind when you think you know is he is it worth having a risking him maybe for this game because of that record we' just love Callum available regardless of the opposition um yeah of course aware that he's done well against West Ham in his career um but it has to be the right decision for him and the long-term um prospects for him keeping fit GRE yeah morning Eddie you uh it's five weeks away now from the January transfer window you've just spent a little bit of time in Saudi where a lot of the hierarchy were there did you have a chance to sit down and talk about the January window for the first time um loose loose discussions I'd say I I think um we will sit down I think in the next couple of weeks and probably firm up those conversations with with more detailed analysis of where we're going to go or where we can go but as I've said many times it's not a as straightforward as maybe everyone will think it's going to be going into January this is going to be a complex window for us lots of decisions to make um in lots of different ways always mindful of the fact that we need to comply with PSL you mentioned there those challenges and you touched on one them PSL and there's a a thought among supporters that because there was 60 million 65 million pound on the table in the summer that that is then automatically going to be there in January is that the case or not in what sense so give give me a bit more before I answer yeah so those the pursuit of Mar in the summer with talk of bids of up to 60 65 million pound does that automatically mean you go into January with a 65 million pound War chest just any excuse to use the word War chest War chest I love that word um firstly I don't think any bid reached that level um that's far on excess I think of of potential what the reality was um secondly no there there's no with PSR rules there's no pot of money that we have sitting there waiting to be spent it's all about um trading in and out and making sure the end that we comply with PSR and I think that's the first Port of Call for us as as a football club is that we have to comply as we did last year um and then of course within that we're looking to improve the squad at every opportunity we can and there's a determination from everyone at the club to do that so it's about getting that balance right than great got to Charlie at the back and then Chris morning Eddie um just on Tino Leo's Journey at Newcastle how much of an initial risk did the club take like given his injury record and um how how much do actual mental toughness from to come back and get his career back on track yeah talking about the player firstly yeah Tino's from minute one I think since he came here shown a real strength of character like for me I didn't see a player that was in any way hesitant or nervous he was all in from minute one joined in training was physically fine one of our best athletes straight away so you wouldn't have necessarily known he was coming from the back of a long-term injury um did we take yeah I think there was a there's always an element of risk about every signing and I think people think when I say that that it's just a cliched answer but there is you could sign a player that's never been injured before you take a risk they could get injured on the first day of training so there's there's always that risk obviously the risk is highlighted or heightened if if someone's cominging off the back of a long-term injury as Tino had but for me that was the only reason that we were in a position to sign him because he'd had that injury if he hadn't he wouldn't have been attainable so yes we decided to um to sign him and I'm delighted we did I mean it's turned out to be a brilliant signing it's turned out to be a brilliant move for him as well I think because he's been able to [Music] um come into the squad and there wasn't necessarily a pressure to play straight away because we had Kieran in playing in such good form and coming off the back of a long-term injury that was probably what Tino needed a period where he just trained um and he wasn't thrust into action too quickly so we we're able to manage him well and he hasn't looked back since and given his form in the last couple of games and his England debut is the shirt his to lose now even when ke trip comes back well it'll be interesting to see I mean I think from our side we've always said that especially in our Champions League season we needed two outstanding players for every position that's still the case now of course we got less games this year but we need a squad that is capable of riding any injuries um that we suffered last year you could see the the importance of the squad so I feel we've got two outstanding right backs when you add em craft to that we've got three outstanding right backs um three international players so um that I wouldn't say there's ever going to be one player for that position it's going to be interesting to see how all the players fight for their places okay few to get through go start with Chris then we'll go to Kieran Martin and Simon more Eddie just checking in on uh Anthony Gordon's Fitness because he obviously came off at Forest and he suggested that it might have been a recurrence of a similar problem earlier and that he might not even make the squ obviously he did is that an ongoing problem that he's managing or is he all right no he's fine fine as far as I know he trained for England pretty much straight away um and played both games so I think he's 100% fit and just on you mentioned goal scoring earlier The Forest game was the first time that You' scored three goals in the Premier League this season the first time you'd won a match by more than a single goal margin how important was that both psychologically and in terms of the the in the Premier League how how given you goal scoring record in the past couple of years before this yeah it's a strange one for us because we've been free flowing not every game of course but that there's been a general feeling we've been free flowing in that respect since we've been here uh this season's been a bit of a struggle for us um to hit the Heights in terms of our attacking play um so it was great to see us score three goals it was great to see us back to what I felt was a really good attacking performance um we missed chances as well but there was a general feeling within the game that we could score at any time and that's uh obviously us playing close to our best morning um I just ask how Joel Linton is obviously it's the first time you've spoken since what happened yeah um Joe is Joe is fine um obviously shaken up initially um had several conversations with him about his situation and his family and his family's wellbeing which is of course the priority very sad really to see that happen to him again I once is bad enough to see um him in that situation again in the same property um same outcome I felt really sorry for him and um we're obviously as a football club helping him through this process and doing everything we can to ensure the safety of himself and his family and his possessions we're seeing this happen to sports people across the country is becoming a growing concern for clubs it is it's something we've been aware of for a long time and we've been trying to give the support to the players um in terms of trying to make sure that we're as strong and resilient as we can in terms of safety and um procedures that the players need to put in place to protect themselves and their properties um it is a growing concern I think there's been a lot of work done to provide that support and make sure that we are looking at prevention and and ways to make sure that this doesn't happen again um certainly we'll try to do everything we can to um improve that side of things for the players hi Eddie you've mentioned Lewis Miley there how important is it to see an academy product come through and flourish at First Team level yeah it is important we it's something we want we really want to do um not in isolated cases but in um with frequency if we can um I'd say we're probably in a better position now than we have been through the investment in the academy through the work done by Steve Harper and his coaching team I think it's been really good um so I've been really pleased with with what I'm seeing from uh the academy and uh everything that they're putting in place and the work being done there that I I'm very confident there will be players coming through um I think there is players coming through now but there will be more in the future um certainly there's been some ey catching recruitment as well in the uh younger age groups as well so I think there's a lot of work going on these things do take time but I do think there are players coming that can make a difference we forget he's only 18 how good can he be and what position will he will eventually be his best position yeah I think he can be as good as he wants to be I think he has all the tools most importantly I think he has the right mentality which is something you you can't always give a player and you can't coach a player um he has that very um strong quality of Mo like highly motivated but low maintenance um and an old head on young shoulders so I think he's got in that respect the most important tool playing wise I think he has everything he needs um I think he'll be a combination of a holding midfielder and attacking midfielder it's difficult to know which way he will pivot at the moment um but he can do both which is such a a rare thing and you if you watch Manchester City's players coming through there's so many born within a 30 or 40 mile radius of the club can the Northeast replicate that in terms of talent well it's interesting I've got a unique perspective because I'm seeing Grassroots football every Sunday when I can um yeah I think I think the passion here is for football is unprecedented it and I see it as I say every time I experience an a an Under 11's game or an under 14's game as as I'm watching um The Passion of the the kids most importantly the ones playing the game that they love the game and I think when you have that you've got a great starting point then of course we have to you know try and improve the coaching and the facilities as well and some of the facilities locally isn't um as may be as good as it can be especially when the weather hits that you'll see a little cancellations and if players aren't playing you're not going to develop them so there's there's still some areas that need consideration and in the PSR world it is vital that you do that isn't it it's absolutely massive if you can reduce your own players you're you're way ahead of the game um and that's not necessarily to sell them going back to the Elliott Point that's not that's not where we want to be we want to produce players that play for Newcastle for many years but you're way ahead of the game because you're not then reliant on transfer fees to recruit players in okay Simon to finish morning Eddie the Premier League clubs have been voted in this morning on Associated party transactions whereby you know what they are do I well associate part trans actions are um you know companies that the pif own or other other nation states clubs um being able to pump in money through sponsorship deals and you've got to do a fair value Premier League clubs have been voting on that massive issue it's seen as a massive issue this morning um and the at least 14 clubs have voted for Associated party transaction rules to to be kept meaning this restrictions will be kept on clubs like Newcastle maning is literally just this isue just happened um it's been seen as a massive defeat for Manchester City and possibly clubs like Newcastle or we don't know how you voted but um how important is that Associated party transactions for your PSR and your future development of the club and can you tell us how how Newcastle voted um I can tell you nothing um I don't know how we voted um and it's not something really I'm on top of so you're telling me that and I actually didn't know that that vote was happening right this second so I think you can tell where my priorities are and I'm about to leave and do a meeting for West Ham so um I'm sure these things are being taken care of from other people at the football club um but I think you'll understand I'm focusing on the team yeah um is a restriction on how quickly the the club can develop and you've mentioned in the earlier in the press conference about the need for greater Revenue so it could be kind of a a setback for the club yeah but again this this is for for other people to consider I think for me I have to make the football decisions um based around the rules that are set and no doubt this will have a knock on effect potentially for us and me and will have to navigate um in other areas
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,q6vn_ctDqC4,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6vn_ctDqC4,good morning Eddie firstly can we just get your reaction to Lewis Hall's um call up by England to the senior squad for the first time and how much you feel he deserves it yeah delighted for for Lewis um I think he's had a really really good start to the season very consistent um really mature displays I think um still a lot more to come from him I I think uh we're seeing him evolve and develop week in week out at the moment I think is adding layers to his game all the time um but yeah I mean it's it's a great achievement for someone so young and uh we're all delighted for it you signed last year initially on loan a very talented player who'd come through Chelsea's Academy but how much progress have you seen in his game and also the willingness to work with you and learn and improve over the last 12 months or so yeah as you say we signed a very talented player there was no no doubt about that um just had a few um things to to work on as we all do regardless of age but I think the most impressive thing about Lewis last year was that he committed to that and [Music] he the work that he put in behind the scenes that no one sees the double sessions the the individual work credit to him uh for doing that and staying um very sort of in the present and able to uh day in day out produce consistent good training performances he's now reaping the rewards from that and we say to new players all the time when they come to the football club um you have to go through sometimes a process to get to the end the end point um but the most important thing is that you commit to that and he did and um yeah credit to the coaches as well who've worked with him and it's not just um me of course it's a real team of people that work with all the players um and I'm really pleased for Louis's family he's got a great family that are really behind him um that really support him and supported him during the move so I think it's a really positive story and on the other side of your Newcastle defense at the moment you have Tino liento who isn't in the senior England squad this time but has been called up already this season how happy are you with his performances and what he's giving the team during this run in the side very pleased with his recent performances I think he's shown his strengths I think that's key to any player you've got to be clear in what you are and how to produce your best performances of course to show your strengths and I think his attacking his dribbling with the ball in wide areas and in central areas has been really good still feel again there's more to come from from Tino especially in the attacking third with assists and chance creation uh but I think his defending as well when you look at the opponents he's been uper guess in recent games and how well he's nullified um certain player strengths his 1 V one actions have been very good defensively so again I think his career is in a good place and he's got to continue to improve Nottingham Forest away on Sunday you've already played them at the city ground this season in the League Cup they're having a great season aren't they third in the Premier League table as it stands yeah they are and um I think Nuno deserves huge credit for the job that he's done um they have I think recruited really well in recent transfer Windows uh they've I think they've added some really good good players to their squad they've got a a way of playing that really works for them very tough to play against I think you can see from their defensive record this year how strong that is and what a test that's going to pose to us to to try and um score against them and I think that's given them them the platform then to to score at the other end a really solid defensive base with really good um pacing wide areas uh and threats in the forward positions and Chris Wood was a very valuable member of your team and your squad but during his 12 months playing for Newcastle he didn't give you the goals that he's been able to score for Nottingham Forest but how happy are you to see him flourishing having made that move I'm delighted for Chris on a personal level because I think for me it was never lost how well he played for us um he did everything but score um in terms of his positive performances were so important in our efforts to stay in the league especially that first season when he joined the work that he did the Unseen thing things that bringing other players into play I think if you asked his his teammates that played with him in that season they say Chris was one of the reasons that we changed our position in the league and was able to win consistently but he just didn't get the goals that then elevated his performances or probably got the The Wider World seeing what a transformation he um played in in our team but he was very selfless he was very team orientated and that's why now on a personal level for him he's getting the IND vigil accolades that his goals are um are bringing him and I'm delighted for him personally a great lad great attitude um I think he had a really good time with us um and uh yeah really pleased to see players go on and do well Kate morning Eddie morning uh three years ago today you were stood there uh St James's park with a scarf above your head uh ready for the challenge that that lay ahead so happy birthday how does it how does it feel looking back on that three year yeah it feels it feels good to still be here because when you come in you you're never sure you're never sure how things are going to go and you come in with the the best intentions you come in with lots of dreams and lots of emotions really because as you say there there's uncertainty there's sort of some insecurities because you're you're going into the unknown and lots of challenges awaited us at that moment the first priority of course was to St stay in the league it was the only thing that consumed me in that moment and um yeah we we got through a lot of work trying to make certain changes but also try and get the best out of what was already here and when you look back at the three years as a whole you just think I think back to loads of positive memories lots of good feelings and um I'm so pleased with how it's gone I'm so um as I say thrilled to still be sat in the position and and still dreaming of what may lie ahead yeah so sounds there from from from the way you're speaking that you're you're happy with the the progress yeah of course I'm happy with the progress you always want more you're always um not entirely satisfied because we haven't got the the one thing that we we wanted when we coming in when we came in sorry which was a trophy that's the dream that's still the dream um and it's still driving us yeah what is your biggest learning over the last three years particularly about the the football club and and everything that comes along with it I don't I don't think there's one thing Keith it would be great to give you a sound bite and to sort of give you the the one thing but I think there there's just lots of little things that you you pick up and you learn and you develop and you change and sometimes personally you don't realize you're changing but you you are and through time I think that's a natural process as well so I think the key thing for me is to just to try and give my best every day to bring long-term success here and to try and bring solid foundations to the football club so whoever comes in next um has a chance to take the club on and be successful as well on on chriswood and Elliot Anderson two players where you've said a number of times in this room that you you really liked were were those examples of players that obviously you've had to sell for PSR reasons but were those examples of players that you've sold well or how do you how do you you you view that now because obviously both of them flourishing at Nottingham Forest um yeah I don't really tend to look at it selling well I think Elliot was a sale that we didn't want to make no one at the football club internally wanted to make that sale but we had to so I think that one is a very unusual in an very unusual Place really because I think that will be happening again not not just here but at other football clubs where you're selling players for finance financial reasons I don't think it's something that's really been done a lot in the history of the game unless you're under Financial restrictions where you have to sell and of course that's happened many times but in terms of a club that has Financial backing but has to sell because of the rules that's a new one um uh Chris's one was slightly different because I think it was really thinking of Chris and we had obviously Alex and Callum uh and Chris three experienced um Strikers that all would want to play uh and start games and Chris felt that um you know you know he wanted that opportunity to play week in week out and we reluctantly agreed to that um but as I said I don't think there was any ill feeling it was always each other's blessing and uh you know you have to sell players and trade to um in the modern environment with Chris Wood and the goals that he's he's scored this season he's he's obviously on fire and that's what the injuries you've had at the top end of the of the pitch I know obviously you can play Anthony in there and you have is he the striker that you've perhaps you've perhaps missed in the early weeks of the Season well I certainly think we've missed Callum there's no doubt about that um callum's uh list of qualities is is long um his experience is Rich we've missed that knowhow and um the ability to rest Alex and rotate Alex I think will who was brought in as that um young striker to develop is really coming along nicely we're really happy with him but of course um you're always going to miss a striker of Cali's quality and caliber just um finally for me in terms of uh injuries the is there anything fresh after after Arsenal you missing anyone I don't think we're missing anyone new no I don't think there's anything new that's developed um we're still in the situation where we're working to get the players back that are currently injured I think they're all in a a decent enough place on their respective Journeys back um so yeah we're happy will the weekend come too soon for for Kon and Callum yes yeah thanks thank you Andy well EDD uh I'm not going to presume how a premier league manager celebrates a third thir year anniversary but hypothetically speaking when Jason does bring in a big kick with candles and you blow them out um what are you going to wish for from your fourth year at the club would you say well I think the celebrations is a press conference which is which is lovely um I think the fourth year I I think we we're looking at progression we're looking at Improvement we're looking at um a really tight Premier League this year so consistency I think is a big a big word for us not not not necessarily the most interesting response I know but these are the things that we judge ourselves by I think if we can find that consistency and the ability to win games um especially consecutive games it's going to be I think it will remain a tight Premier League this year so the teams that are able to put those winning spells and sequences together we have the best chance of success and that's what we're trying to do I was speaking up block the other day and he was recounting a story where he saw you driving out of somewhere and you waved in him he turned into a little child ful of grown block have you after three years kind of come to terms with just how much I guess you mean to the people of Newcastle already yeah I think that's part of the the change really in terms of you come in um sort of wide-eyed and want to make a positive impression and try and um yeah be successful and do everything it takes to be successful and then you realize that how big this club is and the loyal support we have the the fascination of the football club in every aspect of the city is is geared towards the football club so I think that they they're the things that notar surprise me because I knew that before coming in but I think when you're living it and feeling it yeah you know the power that you have as the football club and we have to use that for the good and get out into the community and and help people and meet people and I'm never Amazed by that that reaction that you talk about um I've got used to it now but it's still it's still so nice and still so um so rewarding really in many ways just uh one on Lewis Hall how important is the word patience these days especially in modern day football when there's not a lot of patience flying around especially when it comes down developing a young player like Lewis yeah I think I've used that word a lot in in press conferences in my time here I think sometimes people can look at that as you know are you're hiding something when you ask for patience especially with players and especially young players really and where you're trying to develop their careers and develop their game but patience is something you need and I know that as a father when you're you know with with your kids and whatever you're trying to help them with whether it's your maths their maths or whatever subject or part of their life you know you can get frustrated and you can get impatient with their development but you need to sometimes just be calm and and let them develop in their own way and I think we we always try and push the players and we always try and help them um and Lewis is a really good case in point for us now to point to in the future to go look and and it was the same with Anthony exactly the same people forget that you do go through a period with every player and it's it's a different times you you can never look at one case in point and go right that's how long it will take you it's all unique to the individual but Lewis really committed to the work and as I say now he's reaping the rewards just fin just one on Forest I think I was reading somewhere they've got the same record after 10 games as Leicester did in that famous title winning season do we live in an environment in football anymore where dreams can come true like it did for Leicester can Notting them for us do something like that do you think or in the modern day world are we looking at a premier league where you've got your Manchester City's Your Arsenal and your Liverpool's escon at the top of the league no I still think amazing things happen in sport and I think that's why the sport in in particular is so um interesting to the world because these things can happen I mean you see it time and time again uh in different phases whether that's FA Cup or whatever the competition leicester's title win no one saw coming really I don't think even Leicester saw it coming at the time uh but it was an amazing thing for football and I think really good for football at that time that a team can upset everybody and prove people wrong so yeah nothing for us will believe in and the same sense we believe you know we believe that we can do that whether we're going to win the Premier League um within the next um group of years who knows but we believe that we can do extraordinary things um and that is the focal point of everything that we you work towards every day Nisha morning Eddie I'm just returning to Elliot Anderson you know obviously you didn't want to sell him but do you think with hindsight it was a good move for him bearing in mind the depth you have in Midfield and the game time he's had at Forest and how he's grabbed that opportunity with both hands I think Elliot saw it that way to to a point I don't think he wanted to necessarily leave his the club that he's come through and um very attached to emotionally but I think sometimes it can be a good thing for both parties obviously we needed the deal to happen for PSR reasons and Elliot saw an opportunity then to go to a really good Progressive football club and to play potentially more regularly as as you say um certainly reaping the rewards from those games that he's played I've watched a lot of him I think he's been really good and impressive this year through no surprise to us you know we're looking at him going that's the player that we we saw for us at the back end of last season when he played a lot in our team but he's got goals in him he's got assists in him he's got he's got product to his game and I think we'll see that in the future and you touched on it before but just how tight this premier league is you you win on Sunday I think you're just a point behind forest does that give you that extra motivation to go into the break kind of right up there again yeah I think it does because I think you look at the league as you say we had a disappointing run of results um but we never felt we were too far away and if you can put a consistent run of results together then your the whole feeling around everything changes so there's some teams that would have considered to have an unbelievable start and we're nipping at the heels um and we have to go into this game with that mentality um you know we're almost coming from behind and we've got to catch up the teams above us but we're looking to do that and just finally for me what are the plans for the team in the international break for those players that aren't on International Duty yeah the plan is to get some more with the training in so we will go to Saudi Arabia for some training I think for 3 to four days and then we'll come back go to Dominic morning Eddie just on the injuries situation Jacob Murphy is he okay for Sunday he should be okay and svm botman and Jamal lels after the international break will be nearing that sort of 9mon recovery period just how close are they what's the latest on them yeah they I think they're in different uh spells of their recovery Jamal will be a sometime after Sven sven's making good progress um we hope that he can begin like training with us within the next few weeks um but there's still a a jump from training to playing so we still need to be patient with them again if we see him before um the end of the year that that would be a bonus but we're probably looking more um January with him thank you got to Jordan and then Le Ryder Ty just after Sunday there'll be 11 games into season you have to contend with a third international break of the season do you find the number of international breaks at the start of the Season excessive and how much has that impact your squad having a group of games break and then a group of games again yeah I think it all depends on your schedule I think if you're a team that's in Europe probably welcoming the breaks if you're a team that's not in Europe you're probably a little bit feeling a stop start for us um but we knew at the start of the Season that the schedule there's no moans or gripes with that um I think it also depends on what flow you're in as you come to the break if you're winning games you want more games in in quick succession if you're not sometimes a break can be good for you and after two really positive results at home how important is it now that you followed up away from home to build that as run of consistent results yeah um yeah two really good results and performances at home now we're looking to as you say take that into our away performances which have been been okay um but we haven't got the wins and the points returned that we would have wanted on the road so uh we're hoping to change that thanks Jord Le Eddie just looking at the sort of tight nature of the Premier League team table um compared to the start of the season when you there was a lot of talk of top four would qualifying for any of the three competitions now be class as an achievement yeah I think we've said before well I've said before that European qualification is definitely a target for us and I don't think of course with certain competitions you'd prefer to qualify for I'm not not going to sit here and say that's not the case um but depending how the season goes I think any form of European qualification and certainly from last year we would have taken any competition we narrowly missed out and I think the same would apply this year just on ellot Anderson you've obviously got so much competition for places is it fair to say he's getting opportunities at notam Forest he might not have got at this club how stay difficult to say Lee because you're never quite sure how the season's going to um unfold now for us we loved Elliot um and he was slightly different again to the whichever position you look at him in whether he's a Winger or or as a Midfield player for us he's slightly different I think one of the things that we really liked was his um ability to be adaptable and play different positions and also to use those qualities from a both an attacking and a defensive perspective we used him at the back end of last season in Key games and he did brilliant defensive roles for us which enabled us to play a certain way and win win big games so um he was adaptable Tech technically excellent and as I say I think in the future he's going to be a regular goal scorer in the Premier League just on obviously your three years here I mean a lot of satisfying moments is the one you could sort of pick out or is it staying in the staying in the league is it qualifying for Europe or is it something completely random I think it's all those things you've mentioned so I think staying in the league the Champions League season was incredible but even last year I think we had some amazing moments and I think the challenge for us is to continue to bring those moments and those games that you immediately spring to Spring to your mind that that bring those emotions and those memories they're the ones you're craving so hopefully there's more to come for us thanks Lee we'll go to Mark Rebecca and Chris I hi Eddie s you mentioned um there about PSR and how kind of forces you to sell plays is it particularly frustrating when you've got to sell a player that you put a lot of work into as an academy player you think the Premier League really needs to kind of look at that because I think it's been mentioned before there's an incentive to sell Academy players for PSR reason yeah I think I've said before I don't understand that that rational really like why we're in a position that you're incentiv to sell Academy products uh it's I don't necessarily think they started with that intention but the rules of forcing teams to make those decisions um so for us to put all the work into Elliott that the academy the the coaches the time um to then see him leave and now flourish for another Premier League Football Club is um isn't something I think we should be in a position to do I think it should be more of a level field that you you can sell players and have the same effect that it was with Elliott of course it was all profit for us his sale and that's why um yeah we were incentivized to sell him I just another question on injuries you seem to have had a better record this season in terms of keeping players here is it is that um you know satisfaction for you that you've been able to keep more players and have more availability this season is it just a schedule or is it something else that's happened within the club I'm reluctant to give a clear answer to that because you don't want to Temp fate um at the moment we're looking pretty good um we're still nursing a few injuries but I think a whole combination of things as I said last season we're getting the injuries is not one thing if it was it would be a lot easier to to fix um the schedule definitely plays a part in that we're having less games and the games are the ones that uh produce the most fatigue um but there's other things I think we're working smarter I think James bunts has coming and had a really positive impact as well so lots of uh little things I think that we're that helping us keep the players on the pitch thanks Mark hi ready hi obviously three years for you but also your family as well just how much have they enjoyed life in the Northeast yeah they are um we speak about it with them regularly to check they're okay and um enjoying everything that the Northeast is uh is giving them really they're really happy at their school or schools um doing well as well so uh checking up on their grades and they're in a good place so now I'm really really pleased with them they seem happy I'm developing accents as well and um I'm having to the terminology and what certain words mean but um no they're they're fully embracing it and loving it and obviously just looking ahead to Forest at the weekend just how much can you take from The League Cup game and um what can you learn from forest about that or have they changed so much since that you kind of having to relook at what the team can do at the weekend I think with that game I think they they changed a lot of their players um so I think and they changed system if I remember rightly in that game as well so not sure we can take too much from that one but certainly their recent games they haven't deviated too much in terms of their plan but it's been very very effective I think they've they've got a way of playing that's worked very very well for them um and it's getting the best out of the individual players within their squad as well so it's seeing certain individuals Thrive so I I think we know what to expect um but I think most teams have felt the same thing going into their games and and their results have been very consistent so yeah we're going to have to find a way to pose a threat and of course nullify their their threats and strengths still a few to get through we start with Chris then Craig and then Dom Shaw Chris M Eddie you said that consistency is a big word for you and something that you look at in terms of judging your side what have you seen in the away performances so far this season that you think you can change to become more consistent on the road yeah I think um our away performances have been a slightly mixed bag so the consistency hasn't been absolutely what we want it to be I I think the Fulham games are standout negative for me where we we didn't perform at any level um I think the other games we've seen really good bits within the games and then some some inconsistent moments within the same game and I think to win on the road you have to have to have that solidity and that um energy and and everything that we always speak about in terms of our best performances we need to see we need to see their right for minute one especially against the teams that are in form um and doing well and Notting the forest every time we've been historically the atmosphere there has been electric and we expect no different this will be a really tough examination of our um away form um and our mentality when we go on the road and you you've spoken before about the playing that s James is obviously in in the lift the crowd gives you have you found a formula yet that you think can translate onto the road whereby you don't necessarily need the St James as Park crowd and that you can put in the same intensity maybe that you do short all well well we're searching for that of course and I think there's a lot that goes into it we're looking to get the right balance in the team um certainly in previous Seasons we've done that in the Champions League season I think we found a formula where we were the same team regardless of where we played we had the same characteristics and we really need to uh discover that quickly this season in order to have the season that we want morning Eddie when when you first arrived there was a lot of noise not necessarily from you but talk of Premier League titles within five years Champions League you mentioned earlier to Keith there about your motivation being that trophy has there been a realignment of those immediate Ambitions with you within the club and that is your your drive and force now that domestic trophy I don't necessarily think we've had a a meeting that has discussed aims and targets for the season it it's not really been that clearly defined I think the want is to improve move across the board at the football club from you know from the bottom up in every way to try and bring long-term success I think long-term success and stability and consistency of league position is the aim and of course then you hope through time you can get to where you want to be in terms of trophies and qualification for Europe so I think it's been looked at longer term than short term and targets and and where you're going to finish just going back to Elliot as well there's three players you've seen now Ino Lewis and Anthony have all come in as players who had no senior exposure at the England squad they have all under your watch gone in to achieve that even though to us UNCA at the moment you look at Elliot Anderson is he a player who could make that jump in that inclusion like they have without a shadow of doubt in my opinion I think I remember having many conversations with Elliott about his International future because that that was slightly up in the air I think he qualified to play for Scotland and for me depending on who he wanted to play for I'm not going to sort of discuss those conversations but he he should set his dreams and his aims very very high because for me that it was obvious that he had the ability to get to wherever he wanted to go so I think England is a big aim for him um and I see that in his future definitely got Dominic Simon and then Kier just one um Le you've talked about the patience there can can he be motivation and inspiration for this season yeah he can I think he can and I think it's useful for players to look back at other players' Journeys and histories and their experiences we've got a lot of experienced players in the squad it's not just Lewis you could talk to every player in the squad they' have had moments in their careers where they've had to wait and buy their time to get what they ultimately want but it's what you do in that period it's what you do when you're not in the team how do you get into the team and I think for players like willit commit to your work work harder than everybody else identify the areas of the game that needs Improvement and then go and do it so I think to look back at Lewis for a player like will would be beneficial Simon hi Eddie um very important question if your kids have a Jordy accent when are you going to get one I've wondered that I'm thinking it's coming um obviously they pick up a lot from school and um they've got a you know really good network of friends uh so uh I'm surprised by some of the the things they're coming up with but uh obviously I'm not uh socializing their Circle so I'm sure that continue to surprise me sightly more seriously um when you said before um you want to achieve extraordinary things at the club um what would there be can you put your finger on anything and what would you say to people who think that this club is blocked from achieving extraordinary things um I think blocked is a strong word I think I always believe that we can achieve uh anything now that's easier said than done of course we then have to go to work and try to do that and you're always trying to get more out of what you have get um the best out of every resource that you have available to you I don't know what that is but but we will strive to to hit it we've seen the progress the club has made in the last three years what what do you think needs to be done behind the scenes to kind of be classed as Elite in the next three years yeah as I said earlier I think it's about improving everything that we do so if you look at the training ground you walk around the training ground now it's unrecognizable from the training ground where we first walked into um but it can't stop because in three years time that training ground won't be um in the class that it is now so you can't you can't stop development of any aspect of the football club football changes so quick and the demands change um so quickly so we have to keep a pace with that so it's extraordinary changes really you go to any Department any area of the football club you go to the academy it's unrecognizable um but we have to keep a pace with every other club because the demand's so high so um that's what we're trying to do I'm not sure if the international break gives you a chance to look ahead to January and have a few meeting do you fore that being a quiet window with the rules how is it unpredictable at the moment I think it's unpredictable at the moment I think it's very difficult to see what's going to happen I think January I know no one wants to hear it but is always a difficult window um in every way so I don't think we should necessarily go into it expecting any different to any other previous January that there's been generally transfer trading was down last summer compared to the previous summer so will this January then follow suit so will it be quieter across the board possibly yes so the these are things that don't go in favor of a busy window so um without want to make predictions i' I'd be surprised if it deviated from that thanks K Gary morning Eddie morning uh Dan burn recently revealed that he started his coaching Badges and spoke about his ambition to become you know manager in the the future can you see a potential manager in him and what is it what the attributes you've seen that make you think that if so well I didn't know that um yeah I can see Dan I definitely see leadership skills in Dan there's absolutely no doubt about that and he's a big part of our leadership group I think he is of course he's a big presence both physically but also um emotionally I think he's very very uh caring looking across the squad helping people all the time he's always in the community mixing with Newcastle supporters and I think that's an important aspect because he sees the bigger picture and I think to to lead effectively as a manager or as a a coach or be in that leadership position you have to see across the board you can't have a narrow view of life I think Dan's got a rich experience um so yeah I can see I can see that if that's what he wants to do and there's been a lot of debate recently about the pathway for English coaches coming through obviously you did your coaching badges with the Irish yeah F what was the reason you did that rather than yeah not not all my badges it was the the the uh Pro license and the a license for me it was about speed so I needed being a manager and thrust into management a very early age I think it's difficult to remember but going back to my 30s but I think I had my B license when I was a manager become a manager so I needed my a license as quickly as possible um otherwise I wouldn't have been able to continue in the role so I think it was about speed and that was the the next course available okay simp press conference
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,nH01hxZxgZU,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nH01hxZxgZU,hi Eddie good morning um Chelsea the other night fantastic result for you great performance how much do you feel you all needed the positivity that that brought you yeah I think we did um really pleased with the response from the players wasn't an easy game was never going to be um but I thought our performance was was very good and thankfully we got uh the reward for that performance two good goals clean sheet as well so um it was a good night and the draw has you at home in the quarterfinals another Premier League team brenford um I suppose you just wanted to be at home against possibly anybody that's the key St James's Park yeah I think whenever you go into a cup draw um the home aspect for us is really important it has been important um for for a while here in the environment again on uh Tuesday Wednesday um was uh was Second To None it you know it was a sellout it was a there was a really good feeling can't think the support is enough for that um there was no hangover from you know recent results it was it was really good and um that helped us massively now yeah we've got a home draw tough game against brenford are in good form so we look forward to that that's further down the line now we go back to the Premier League how much of the performance of well a number of players including those who were brought back into the team against Chelsea um give you a tough set of decisions to make for Arsenal yeah it was good to see so many players performing well I think um a lot of players that came in did themselves no harm at all um it was good to be able to rotate some of the the squad to see the strength and depth that we have in certain positions um I think three games in six days for us is a is a challenge especially early kickoff again so we're going to have to see how the players are physically pick a team according to physical well-being for and and and obviously our opponent and is Midfield particularly difficult for you given the performance of Sandro t in a slightly different role Bruno coming on playing a slightly different role himself but also sha longstaff and Joe Willock coming back into the team and and giving you something extra too yeah I think those players that you mentioned they're all very very good players in their own right and as I said when you face three games in six days I think it's it's great to have those options um you know I think it's a tough ask for someone to play all three games you it's not impossible but it's a tough ask and are they going to be at their best absolute best physically in all three games I'm not sure um so to have the ability to to rotate and to um hopefully everyone enters the pitch feeling in a really good condition there are a couple of knocks in the squad as well so we'll have to assess how everyone is today Arsenal um it's almost a year to the day I think since you played them at home last season and you got what was a a really important result um controversy from their point of view about the goal what do you remember about the match nothing I don't remember the goal I don't know um no it was a I I do remember it being a great atmosphere very very um physical game very competitive two teams absolutely going at each other in a really competitive way I thought it was a really good advert for the Premier League of course there was controversy around the goal and I understand that um but just positive emotions really from the day last thing um you told us I think a week ago that Callum Wilson wouldn't feature in any of the three games this week how is he doing and is there a chance that he could play next week against Nottingham Forest yeah he's doing okay um he's building his load again um as I said there was no real injury um but uh just a feeling in his body that he couldn't push as hard as he wanted to push or needs to push to to play at this level is physically you have to be able to sorry you have to be perfect really in how you feel um yeah we'll make a decision he's definitely out for this game um will make a decision based on how he feels for Nottingham Forest um but probably with The twoe Gap it probably makes sense to leave him thanks R Keith morning Andy um you said a moment ago that you got a couple of knocks um ahead of this one able to tell us who they are no they're just general fatigue really game fatigue I think it was a a good physical game against Chelsea both both games on the Sunday and the Wednesday were um it was intense matches so normal game fatigue that you get 24 hours after a game and 48 hours so we need to make sure whoever enters the pitch um against Arsenal is in their best condition and obviously you you started um Anthony the other night despite him having missed the previous game um and and Alex came off early as well um was that just precautionary with with Alex and how are they with their the recovery from the injuries theyve both had this season yeah I think they both feel okay I think it's one of them we'll assess how they feel today sometimes 48 Hours you can feel different do you do to to 24 hours it's not um necessarily always a straight line with how the body feels the they both had niggling injuries Alex had his toe um Anthony's had a groin so uh we'll make a decision today I know you said there a moment ago as well it's good to rotate and it's it's difficult for any player to play three high level games like that in the space of well on six days isn't it um but the the performances of those that came in I'm thinking of Sean Long staff Lloyd Elliot Center back do they they give you a bit of a a headache with regards to your your team selection yeah they certainly um give you um the ability to to change the team and I think many times I've said I don't want the necessarily the team to pick itself but I also don't want to be going game to game changing too many players I don't think that's healthy either so I believe in a settled team but of course with midweek fixtures especially the intensity of games now I think you have to have the ability to rotate so let's see I'll pick the strongest team that I can um that I think gives us the best chance to win and obviously Bruno normally always plays and he plays in that Central role of the three he played Sandro there um the other night did very well I know that might give you a headache of of its own is that somewhere you'd consider deploying him again in the future and could you play them both in the same team with Sandro there and and perhaps Bruno one of the more more forward midfielders yeah I think options are are open um Sandro can definitely play both positions um whether it be higher or or lower and that's why we recruited him in a way because he had that versatility we didn't want to sign um necessarily uh one player for one position we needed that flexibility especially going into the Champions League season that we faced um with Bruno I think Bruno is slightly more complex in terms of where he plays because I think he has natural strengths where he gravitates to the ball and always wants to be on the ball and that's his his biggest strength so playing him away from the ball is is um different for him and it means he has to play more positionally so that's something we'll look at but um I think good players can play anywhere so we'll see and obviously Sandro's been building himself back up since since his ban but it felt like that match the other night was that that was him back to perhaps what we saw against Aston Villa way back at the at the start of last season how much good has that done him the other night tonight and have you noticed an extra spring in his step off the back of it not so much a spring not not not after the game he covered a lot of ground on on Wednesday I thought he I thought he did incredibly well I was really pleased with his performance I thought he played with discipline um he brought a calmness to our Midfield um he always uses the ball well I think that that goes without saying but I think just the the intricacies of the position I thought he got bang on so I was really pleased thanks ke Andy morning uh you said after the game on Wednesday that you hope everyone else feels a little bit better about themselves but most importantly how do you feel about yourself after what what was a big big result yeah I think winning always makes you feel a little bit better about everything um you wake up in the morning and um back to the question I just had there's a there's a spring in your step when you win and when you don't I think you you're sort of soul searching a little bit and trying to find solutions to to potential issues that you have but we know that was just one game and it was in a different competition we have to focus on the Premier League it's such an important um season for us it's such an important competition we know how high the bar is in terms of the level so we now play one of the most consistent teams in the Premier League for the last couple of years um very very good team good very good manager so the challenge for us is is never easy but we're at home um early kickoff I I really hope the atmosphere is going to be ready red hot I'm sure it will be and we give our best there's a a clip of ail craft from Wednesday night marauding forwards um very ail craft like I suppose can you understand why I think they've called him crau the fans has become almost like a cult hero amongst Newcastle United fans yeah I think cfu maybe originated from some of our players in the squad um certainly one maybe one of the coaches as well adopted many nicknames names for for crafty and craf is one that we all love to use internally I think he's just such an unassuming brilliant professional really hardworking so dependable that I think you're instantly um when you meet him you like him you just see that solid um character but also is a very very good player I'm probably very underrated by the outside world but internally I think we all love him and we all see his qualities um we can play different positions for us this year and he's he's been brilliant at the center half I thought he did really well at fullback um players like that always say are so important and we really value him you mentioned positions there you alluded to this on Wednesday night after the game about Joel Linton and how he can play seemingly every single pitch or outfield pitch Outfield position on the pitch um what is his best position do you think it's tough to to give you a definitive answer on that I love him in probably in the two best positions would be as a left eight and as a a left Winger um but I think the beauty of jolon as I said he ended up playing right wing back for us against Chelsea and he goes there and he just gives his absolute best to it with no questions asked and I think that it's quite rare in the modern day that you have a player that g given information that doesn't say why he just says yep no problem I'll do it and that's why I think again he's got the respect of everybody at the football club just finally um where did the Chelsea performance kind of land on the intensity being newcastle's identity scale and where do you hope the Arsenal performance tomorrow lands on that intensity scale yeah it would be up there I think every game's different um and every opponent plays differently so you know we all have our plans and um things in place to try and implement but as I say if the opposition acts in a certain way it's sometimes difficult to execute those so it was a night where things fell into place for us but most most importantly I think when you play the attitude of the players has to um has to be befitting of you know the the expectation set upon them and it and it was right from kickoff you saw Anthony Gordon go and Chase down the keeper then the left side Center half and win a throw in and get a standing evation for his effort so it's that kind of attitude that we need on a on a regular basis thanks Andy Jerry morning Eddie I think a lot of fans certainly from what we can judge by social media reaction this week think you've hit on a real formula with the way you played for example tanali and long staff in in Midfield this week and after a winless run in the league they they're bound to want to see you play more of that pattern in the league do you have some sympathy with that yeah I think it's always um selections are always there to be debated and they always will de be debated especially when you have such a large fan base as we do I think and you're always going to get split opinions on whatever I do and that that's where I have to be sure with my my own decision um I can't second guess myself I've never been that way I've always been very clear on what I feel the need the the team needs I will then obviously put together a team that I think can can execute it so um that's one of the great things about football the debate the uh Intrigue um into into what goes on must be good to have what we all call selection headaches compared to some of the periods when you sat sat in these conferences and and be moaned a very long injury list yeah I mean absolutely I'd prefer it this way where we have um decisions and options than times last year when we had none and this all goes around in uh phases I think um our injury list isn't perfect we still have a lot of very good players that are missing that would make a difference um but it's certainly better than it was at times last year I know you've alluded to this already but um just to reinforce the point Arsenal is going to be much more of an acid test of where you are generally than a than a second choice Chelsea 11 isn't it uh yeah I think every game is very difficult the game again on Wednesday you can put the question like that but CH Chelsea put out an exceptional team so I've got no issue with the level of opposition it was a Premier League game for me um and but this is you know a Premier League game and it'll be it'll be different test Arsenal have got their qualities um they've done again very well this season they've got um a real solid look about their team that don't concede many goals very good from set plays very physical team so we're got to be ready for that test thank you broadcasters we'll go to Damian Lee and then to George hey can I just ask you about Joe willick he's had an awful truck with injuries and B to get back to Fitness how close is he to being able to make an impact on a sustain bis for you he's getting closer I would say I think Joe's has had a tough time with injuries um from what looked like a serious hamstring injury when he when he first um did it a long time ago he then added complications in other areas of his body um and it hasn't been a straight road back for him he's had lots of moments where he's been incredibly frustrated that he hasn't been able to kick on and get to the levels that he has done historically for us I thought Wednesday was probably his best game since his comeback I think he physically looked really really good and that is his game so if he's not feeling physically good I think you lose a major part of his Armory his ability to run box tobox in a really um quick way his ability to sense where the goal is and and where the ball's going to arrive I think he did a a couple of times obviously one for the the second goal and once towards the end of the half where he's he's had to Sprint near a three quarters of the pitch to get on an Anthony Gordon cross that's his that's Joe at his best so I was really pleased to see it he's been a a big Miss for us because he adds a totally different feel in our Midfield a real goal threat um and athletic qualities we need how difficult has that that whole situation been for him and how have you had to man you and your staff had to manage him through it it's been really difficult for him because he's he's young um he wants to play he feels like like every young player does that you he's desperate to leave an imprint at the club and carry on his really good form that he you know he was in a really really good place before his injury and the team was as well um and then when you can't quite get to the bottom of what's wrong with you and it's a lot longer than initially expected it can be incredibly frustrating um and then it's it's probably helped him build resilience and um a changing mentality for him but it's not something I'm sure he want to experience again thanks Daman Lee more NY um the buying of the players uh has been evident I think in defeat and in victory in the last week or so how important is that that for you when you say buying what do you mean yeah okay yeah I think well it's everything if you don't have the players with you in you know in terms of your Tactical preparation and buying into how you're going to play and how you're going to try and win the game then I think you're beating before you start so I think the players have to want to go to work they you have to want to implement everything that you do and that's in out of possession I don't think we've had an issue with that um at all some of our delivery's been slightly inconsistent but I don't think we've had an issue with wanting to do it and wanting to do well but as always there's there's always um issues and problems that arise on a daily basis and you you're just trying to to steer the the team in a in a good direction and how important are Squad members like Emil craft you in my opinion with the squad you can't have 20 um players that always expect to play every minute of every game um you need a balance to the squad and now Craft's entire incredibly driven and wants to play as do all the players in the squad but I think there's different Dynamics and different personalities needed to make the squad harmonious am would be one of those people that creates and helps create a really good environment whether he's playing or not playing and there's several members of the squad that I could speak the same of um that have had incredible impacts here over the last three years that don't necessarily get the credit they deserve but play a huge part A will be one of those we've always talked about Paul damit Matt Richie players historically that have now left um that gave so much more than just what they did on the pitch and those players are so invaluable to me and just on Joe will it's probably easy for people to talk about the injuries he's had but if you put a if you put a sh reel of his goals together it's quite an impressive one because he scored a lot of big goals for this club and now he has and it's it's part of what his game brings he's got that unexpected um ability to do things that you don't necessarily know what he's going to do and I'm sure Joe doesn't know he's one of those players that acts off Instinct a lot of the time but those instincts are usually creative and go driven um so it's great to see him in the box and doing what he does best on on Wednesday um as I say we've missed it a lot when he's been injured okay quite a few to get through go to George first then to Ian morning Eddie morning uh that's what we've been searching for I think that's what you said the other night was was that the blueprint yeah I mean in terms of a high pressing performance and um sort of the off the- ball plan yes but every as I say every game's different if you're playing against a team that plays a different way you wouldn't be able to execute that as effectively so that's where you have to understand that it's not if you don't see see a blueprint of that every week is not necessarily because of our players um input to the game so it's it's always different every game is a different challenge but you still have to find a way to to try and win and um defend your goal effectively I thought we defended our goal effectively really well and not not just in the Press but around our box there was a lot of good blocks and a lot of good um defensive instincts taking over so I was really pleased with how we defended but has has it set a tone do you think in terms of that sort of attitude and is it important that everybody sticks to that kind of tone from now on yeah in terms of the attitude absolutely I mean the attitude is the most important thing because if you enter the pitch not prepared to work you're not going to win any game um and if you're not together and United and absolutely ready to do everything you need to defy the opposition it's not going to work either so we've been a bit inconsistent with our delivery as I've said this season that was much better on Wednesday thanks George we got to Ian Lan and Craig Ian morning Eddie uh as you touched on earlier games against arel can be very physical controversial spiky sometimes ill-tempered does that bring the best out of Newcastle I think it has done historically um I think we've especially in our Champions League season I think we relished those games that that tended to bring out the best in us but I think we were maybe psychologically in a slightly different place I think the whole club was in a slightly different place then in a different place now and we need to make sure that we can um we're adaptable enough to bring that when we need it and also bring another side to our to our game when we need it you can have an idea of how a game will uh follow through but it doesn't always work in that way so adaptability is key um if someone and another team or even ourselves is going to bring that side of our game and it's going to help us in that moment then then it needs to be there on a similar theme we saw in last season's B flying the world documentary you do sometimes choose to wind up your players with with a motivational speech before kick off uh that's one way I putting in yeah right is is this is this one of the games you might choose to and if not when do you choose to do that uh usually based on my feeling um it's not something you can necessarily Force it's got to be natural um I always tried to look at lots of various ways to motivate the players whether that's individually within units within the team when they meeting there's loads and loads of different ways and and usually before a game we'll try every not try everything together but we'll we'll choose a um psychological line to use but only if it's natural and it feels right so will you keep your language clean tomorrow it probably be mixed uh usually I think there's a time to bring out um lots of different things thanks here Luke just to pick up on something Andy asked have you changed your Fitness regime go on well you just looked a bit spritely when you came in is that he knew he was coming to see you that's what I didn't feel spritely coming in so if I looked it I'll take that luk but uh no have I changed a little bit actually yes see there you go intuitive but I i' got no idea if that's reflected in my in my walking gate okay but um on a on a more serious note um Bobby Robson once said about Arsenal that they needed to be able to learn to lose Open brackets with some dignity what did you make of Mikel Etta's Behavior after the game last season I made nothing of it I think for me you've got to understand I'm wrapped in my own world as we all are my own existence my own thoughts and my own thoughts were purely on my own team and how proud I was of them on that day and cuz I felt we we were in a challenging moment of the Season actually we had fixtures piling up um and injuries piling up alongside it so um just really proud of the players that we had available that gave everything to win a really competitive game I thought it was a really high level game as I said I know the goal took the headlines really and the controversy of the goal and as I said I understand it but just really thinking about how proud I was of the group and I hope I'm feeling the same way after after this game again just to pick on something Ian said um you had a bit of a not a nasty streak but you remember all the stuff about the the dark arts and the gamesmanship um do you want your team to to get that kind of I'm trying to F the right word for it but that mentality back a little bit more yeah but I think it's related to to winning I think when you're winning games everything's different you know when you're leading games everything's different if you're chasing games so I think it in part will be overhyped and talked about probably more because we're in that position a lot that season this season we haven't been in that position as as often so you end up being the reactive team trying to trying to chase the game effectively certainly don't want to be in that position we want to be the team in control um but certainly whatever it takes to win within the rules I'm a firm believer in that and I think that's um ability we had to close out tight games that season was incredibly good we managed games very well um we had a different makeup to the team than we do now we had different personalities in there I think we had maybe a little bit more experience in the group um and that that can often pay dividends at that time sorry I just wasted one question on your Fitness regime um do you I presume you want to make it as uncomfortable as you possibly can for Arsenal on and off the pitch I want to make it as difficult as we can for any opposition team coming to St james' park I think that's part of of the beauty of playing at home certainly don't want to make a a comfortable environment for any team and um yeah so we're desperate to do well and performer thanks Luke greig morning Ed you said earlier that Sandro is versatile but every player normally has a preference you know Anthony Gordon is versatile he prefers to play on the left on Wednesday night it looked like Sandro really thrived with that extra responsibility of being the man in the middle I think you said last week he needed more game involvement Wednesday felt like he's most involved game yet has that given you something to think about with regards his position that actually he might want to play in the same position where Bruno does perhaps prefer to play also yeah I think with Sandro I think it all depends on the game sometimes your your central player your six can be more involved and then another game your higher your higher players can be more invol involved it depends on on the game really I don't think Sandro was necessarily heavily involved in our buildup phase on Wednesday but I think he did a really good job at controlling space and making sure we were disciplined as a team defensively I thought he showed a really high level of tactical ability and understanding of that role um consider he hasn't played it in a while he can play both very very well and he has done for for this football club I think I wouldn't want to label him in any one role and I think we need players that are adaptable and versatile could you see that scenario where Bruno and Sandro started in the same team with Sandro centrally and Bruno to the right of him if you go back to Bruno's first season when he was scoring diving headers at the gallager end and chipping the goalkeeper down at norch it seemed he was playing in a more advanced eight and that brought something different out of him yeah Bruno's played that role for us a few times playing the eight role whether we're chasing a game um he started games in that role as I said I think Bruno's biggest strength is coming to the ball a lot of time when you're playing with uh midfielders in higher positions occasionally you want them to to run away from the ball um so that's something that we need to make sure that uh we get right but both players can play all positions they're very good players I've got no doubt that they um they can make it work thanks cig few left we got a Scott Jordan J and then Kieran a finish Eddie um most of the time so far we've seen Lloyd Kelly playing at left back he obviously played center half at the um on Wednesday night played really well yeah um he's he's probably athleticism makes him stand out amongst the other Center half options Maybe a little bit different to what else you've got in there I mean what do you think of him in terms of a sender half and and you know I know versatility is important but can he can he establish himself as a center half yeah he can for sure I think um Lloyd is again following a similar theme very good player in both positions I think last year for Bournemouth he played pretty much dovil between both positions very well for RCA's been used early season as a left back um I think I think the last few appearances he's been a center back I think he looked really comfortable on Wednesday I thought he did really well he is unique in the respect he's got very very good top end Pace very athletic um he's got a lovely left foot as well so very pleased the early days for him settling into a new club but I think he's adapted really well um of course I like him having worked with him previously I know the qualities that he brings um I think he's going to be a really good signing for us and you referenced earlier Arsenal's set players can you just give us a little bit of insight into what if anything you've done about that this week because they're fairly unique in the there's not you you're not scratching around to work out what they're going to do we kind of know where Saka is going to look to put the ball we know who's going to be charging in to get on the end of it but other teams have found it really hard to stop that have you done things differently this week to work around that well not yet we haven't um but to today we will um today we'll sort of go into our match preparation with the players of course earlier week we've been looking at um Chelsea yesterday was about recovering we couldn't work with the players but today we will and we'll cram all our match preparation into one day I think that the set plays is always about your organization and your structures and obviously you need players to want to head the ball and um yeah I'm always reluctant to talk too much about set plays because the intricacies of what goes into it um but hopefully we can nail it and get unque challenge with Arsenal because they do seem to be exceptionally good at it even for a top you know Premier League level top level they stand out well they they're a big side and they've got great delivery and and obviously they practice and rehearse set moves and they um prepare for the opposition as well so I think they're very good um and we're going to have to be very good to repel their threat okay we just move to single questions if we can't to finish Jordan just going back to the cup game and the front fre have ve on the right hand side would you that playing Anthony on the right hand side more often and how would he react to that given his preference to play on the left wing yeah of course it's it's something we'll look at to try and find the right solution for the team I think Anthony Anthony will do what's best for the team he's got no issue with that um but of course we want to see him being effective I thought he was effective on Wednesday I thought he played well I thought he had some really good moments um so yeah I I don't see an issue's he's never said to me that he um would refuse to play a position but no no player would because they want to play football and you know Anthony's a really good team player as well as being an outstanding individual but it's just about making sure that we get him the ball in the right areas and um you know he's effective in that position thanks Jordan J hi Eddie because of what happened in this game last year and maybe a bit of Arsenal's disciplinary record is this a game you really need your lead as like Bruno to sort of Step Up and lead from by example and be a Calon influence on your team to not get involved with any sort of dark AR as anyone said against Arsenal well I think the the key thing in any game Premier League game as we saw in the first game of the season for us keeping 11 players on the pitch is absolutely crucial um playing with discipline playing with emotion and and fire and spirit and all those things is so important but you need emotional control as well so that's something that we'll need to be very aware of just ourselves not talking about Arsenal um you know you always need that control but you need that um that far as well so we need to get the balance right thanks Joe just K the fin morning Eddie um Arsenal obviously have bigger revenues but it's easy to forget they didn't become a regular top four Challenger under Metta a title Challenger overnight um is that instructive for you with newcastle's own journey and and how would you close that Gap ultimately in the coming years yeah I think the key thing for Arsenal I think they've they've recruited very well um I think it always boils down to Long long term success to recruitment of players getting that right on a consistent basis gives you the the opportunity to grow your team one or two mistakes and it becomes very very difficult to to get that growth so I think they've managed the club really well they've seem like they've had good relationships internally um solidity from boardroom level um yeah and and Mel's done a great job on the coaching pitch and he's improved the players that he's had so put that all together and I think naturally you're going to be successful and I think we face all those challenges um uh in terms of trying to do the same thing thanks J see thank very much thank you cheers
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,SfcDr_VC02I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfcDr_VC02I,hi Eddie um how was the break two weeks International Football how was it here for you with players that didn't go away yeah it was good um gave the lad a little bit of time off at the start of the two weeks then trained hard and have trained through in preparation for this this game Lads that have stayed have trained really well and been really happy we've worked on quite a lot have all the international players come back and have they all come back okay without any problems the only one we haven't seen as yet is Miguel Al alaron um he was flying yesterday so we anticipate we see him this morning everyone else is good yeah has come back in in good FAL what about um other players and injury problems firstly Alexander isach has he overcome that toe issue and is he available for Brighton Alex is trained and trained well he trained the start of this week and has looked good so at this moment in time he would be in contention and what's the situation as it stands with Callum Wilson Callum is also trained um but with Callum will'll continue assessing him day by day we've got to try and make the right decision as to when we reenter him into the group could it be the case then with Wilson that he might just need a little bit more time as frustrating as that would be for him and also for you possibly I say it's a day-by-day thing and we're obviously in communication with him I think the big thing with Callum is when we get him back we want to try and keep him back for as long as possible so we got to make the right call looking at this next set of games these block of matches coming up you have got some tough fixtures in there beginning with Brighton at home um how do you see it the the next few weeks and everything that lies ahead of you yeah I think you've um summed it up quite nicely I think there's some tough games but I think great challenges for us a great um stage of the season for us to hopefully hit our best form um when you look at the the group of games that we have to come we've got three at home we look forward to those games um tough away games every game's tough in the Premier League but I think we've had a nice mix about our our early season form we we haven't hit Top Gear um but we've been resilient we've been hard to beat um we need all of those qualities but we do need to uh to find our best form in this group of games to get any results and what do you make of the the challenge that awaits you from Brighton who are level on points with you in the table side by side as it stands um I think in previous years some Newcastle teams have struggled to play well against Brighton so what is it that that they do that makes them a a difficult opponent yeah they are a difficult opponent and and I think they have been historically for us I think we've had some really close games against them um we've won some we've lost some I think they've been fascinating tactical games because every manager that Brighton recruited have been outstanding in that respect I think and fabian's another very clever guy um I think he's continued the philosophy that Brighton have had over many years but has tweaked it his way slightly think they're very Progressive very attacking um I think it'll be a good game between two very open teams so um yeah we'll obviously look to to hit our best form and try and win and lastly you mentioned the Brighton manager there Fabian Herzel 31 years old youngest manager in premier league history I'm sure you can relate to that can't you although it was at a different level you were very young when you were in a dugout for the first time in charge of Bournemouth yeah 31 uh myself and seems like feels like yesterday the reality is it it um it wasn't and I think for the first five six years of my management career every question was on my age sort of got used to that and now people have stopped so uh um I sort of Miss it in a way um but uh no I wish him well I think he's a a really um as I say a bright um bright guy very um strong character to be managing in the Premier League at that age is a huge achievement um and I look forward to uh going against him thank you ke hi Eddie sorry to take you off of Newcastle but we're asking uh our managers last couple of days about the appointment of Thomas tukl as England manager what's your your view on that um several things really I think firstly speaking about Thomas himself I I've got a relationship with Thomas I was lucky enough and fortunate enough to go and see him work at Chelsea um when I was out of work and what what a brilliant guy what a great person what a great coach um I had two days with him and thought he was fascinating really enjoyed his company so um I really wish him well I think he's um a great appointment um yeah I I hope he leads England to uh to many trophies I have always said and I've been very clear on this whenever I've been asked going back years and years my preference would have been for a an English coach um but if you are going to go forign go for the one of the best and I certainly think Thomas is that the the fa have said that 10 managers were were interviewed um were you were you one of those no I wasn't no no was there was there any contact at all from the fa no no um I guess to some that would be a surprise because I think you were probably the outstanding English young English manager um does that bother you at all that that you weren't spoken to I know you've said a number of times that all eyes have been on ucast so you don't let your head kind of rise above that is it something you've been aware of is it something that has bothered you at all absolutely not I think England have to do what is right for them and only they will know the processes they've gone through and the decisions that they've made and I'm certainly not the type of person that's going to analyze that for me it's about New Castle it's about trying to win games and is hard enough to do that if you're 100% focused and and I always remain that way to my work um but I know that if you drop your levels or your focus the job becomes impossible so at no stage of I allowed myself to do that just back to to Newcastle um one player he'll be visiting St James's Park tomorrow is Yan kuber M who obviously the club were were forced to sell due to PSR in the summer I know you spoke about both losing himself and ell Anderson just looking back at that sale in isolation now a couple of months on how do you see it was it was it still the the right thing to do at the time yeah in my opinion it was absolutely the right thing to do but it's still hurts to have done it um we had no other option and no matter what the narrative is in the future regardless of how Elliott does and yanuba does it's still the right thing to do in my opinion for the benefit of Newcastle we couldn't breach PSR couldn't face a points deduction and that the only two deals we had on the table at that time were the two deals that we did so um we didn't want to sell yanuba at all um we believed in his potential and um everything about his profile fitted what we needed but um we had to make a decision based on finances he obviously spent last season out of loone but would he have would he have or the would the plan for him to have been involved with you this season yeah it would have been of course if if he was our um you know we would have utilized his skill set and the attributes that he has and we know tomorrow going against him we're going to have to defend very well because he's got standout qualities Pace power um lovely left foot um so we're well aware of his strength thanks Edie hi Edie hi just taking you back to when you were 31 what did you find the most challenging was it the constant questions about your age or was it that kind of dynamic of dealing with more senior players no I think my situation was different to fabian's I think for me I was sort of thrust into management almost reluctantly at that stage of my career and I hadn't prepared for the role um in the sense that I just started my coaching journey I just started to get my mind around what coach I wanted to be what style of football I wanted to play I was just beginning to to think that way and suddenly I'm managing so I was really learning on the job fabian's had a totally different um path but mine was really sort of finding what my style was going to be and how I was going to try and win games while trying to stay in League 2 you it was a totally different environment for me and you say he's tweaked things what have you noticed that discernably different from last season I think the the main thing would be [Music] um maybe slightly more Progressive in their style uh wanting to get the ball forward quicker um but still in a brighten way that we would know for the last few years but I think that makes them very dangerous because I think they've always had the the very patient buildup the very fluid tactically but now with with progression um makes them a a very difficult team to play against does it feel like you touched on you're hoping to hit Top form soon and the fact that you seem to have more weapons at your disposal coming back with isach and Wilson does it feel like things are going well in that department we hope so um time will tell but I think from what I've seen in the international break from the players that have stayed it's the best feel around the group the best training performances we've delivered albe it with a very small number um I think we focused on some really good work uh but it's always disjointed until the main body of the group come back you you're guessing to a degree of how you're going to look and I think the first game after the intern International break is always a bit um disjointed so we hope that we can sort of get everyone pointing in the same direction very quickly um there'll be a bit of fatigue from some of the lads that have had a long journey back but hopefully everyone will be okay with Callum because we haven't seen him yet this season but he knows his body you know his his body how eager desperate is he how how often are you talking to him about managing expectations that we were in communication every day as I am with all the players at the training ground I'm very um Hands-On with with everybody um callum's no exception so great to see him back on the training pitch he's given all the players a lift to see him back with the group um but as I said earlier we just have to to manage his reintroduction in the right way and just finally your record at home stretching back a long time now is exceptional what's really underpinned that um I think what's underpin that is and I I do said a lot and I'm sorry to repeat myself but is the atmosphere created you can't deny that that has a huge uplifting effect on our performances so the environment created and of course then the players have to produce moments and and um the attributes in order for us to win the games but I do think the environment is the key thing thanks Rob Nisha morning Eddie um apologies just one more on this on this England appointment as one of very few English managers in the Top Flight do you think this country is producing enough homegrown Elite managers um I think it's very difficult to to manage in the Premier League um regardless of your nationality and I think there is a handful of English managers at the moment and British managers and it's great to see but we have no divine right to to manage in the league I think you have to earn your place now mine was through promotion through um through the leagues and I've just managed to to hang in there um but every everyone's route is different but I don't think the Premier League is based on nationality the Premier League is based on your ability to try and win games and um obviously respective of your club's ambition try and hit those objectives um in terms of developing coaches I think the fa have done a lot to try and develop coaches over the years I think the coaching courses now are the best they've ever been so George's Park is obviously a great place to to to work and to um bring everyone together so I think that're they're trying to do the right things I think it's vitally important that that continues you said and you've always been open about your preference for an English manager I mean how far off is that for for England to have a bigger pool because you want a pool of candidates so you can choose the best how far do you think this country is of having a really strong pool of elite managers that could manage the national team I don't know it's not something I've really analyzed to be honest um again I think that's for other people do probably for for you to go through the the possible candidates I think there are some really talented coaches in this country who are English and I I firmly believe that there is real strength the getting the opportunities and the jobs at the elite level is difficult and as I said if you can't um sort of earn the right to get there through a job opportunity then the only way is through promotion and we've seen um some really talented guys get promoted last year and he'll no doubt do well in the Premier League this year so whatever your route is um hard work and dedication to the job is the only way and back to Newcastle you'll probably be relieved to he um you talked about this difficult block of games you mentioned that with raiser now does this squad rotation monitoring of minutes is that kind of starting now I think we always try and make the right decision in terms of who's played what minutes how everyone's feeling physically um you know the amount of data that we get on the well-being of the players now from every day is is huge as detailed as it's ever been so um then you've got to try and find the right balance between making changes and making too many changes um I'm believer again of trying to have a a settled team if possible um with maybe tweaks here and there rather than wholesale changes I don't think that helps because you need consistency to try and get a good run of results and just finally um an update on Miley how he's getting on another player that has been back during the international break looked really good uh yeah looks like he's not been away um which I probably expected with Louie he's that kind of lad very consistent um just been great to see him's he's a a great player and we're delighted to have him but again I've got to manage his reintroduction in the right way than got to Damian and then to Dominic there's been a lot of speculation obviously about you in the England job is it a relief that that's all been put to bed now yeah there was no one more pleased than me to see Thomas get the job really and and take it because it's just a distraction that not that it distracts me but it's just you can see it's unsettling at times when um certain things are said and written about so I think the more that everyone can focus on Newcastle which has always been my only concern the better and you you've spoken a lot about how you love your job here here in the day-to-day aspect of it is is England something that would interest you in the future some somewhere down the line yeah who knows I I've always said that you can never predict what's going to happen in management you can never plan too far ahead I certainly don't um I'm a a sort of a day-to-day planner while also acknowledging that Newcastle I've always said this has a future and we have to make sure we make the right decisions long term but the job takes so many twists and turns you can't look too far ahead I think that's negative actually if you do that um so in terms of my own career and what's five 10 years ahead I don't know I've got no idea but I'd never say that England managing England isn't something I'd like to do maybe one day if given the opportunity but um my focus is Newcastle Newcastle Newcastle thanks Daman Dom morning Eddie you touch on Louis Miley obviously when he got injured he was a regular in the team but now he's competing with the likes of Sandro Tori Joe willick Joe Linton back from injury so is he coming back in a different sort of environment to the one he left he is but I think he's coming back into a great environment because I think coming back from the injury that he's had and he's had a couple of injuries now that's the best place for him to be rather than going right he has to play and he has to play when he's probably not ready to play um because I think the reasons he's got the injury was because all the injuries that he suffered is probably because we had to push him too hard because we had no alternative players to use during a really condensed period of football so I think learning the lessons for that would be really important um as I say reintroducing him at the right time but he's got some outstanding players to compete against which will only help Louie learn and develop anyway so um hopefully we can keep the majority of our strength in field Kieran trippier went off injured against everon just how is he doing after the international break yeah Kieran or miss out from this game um he's picked up a hamstring problem we don't think it's necessarily too serious but probably enough to keep him out for a few weeks thanks Tom go across to Jordan then Chris and Luke more and just obviously Tom bur goes up against his former Club just reflecting on his sort on the a three years at the club has he surpassed expectations anyway in turns he's importantance not just on the pitch but off it as well yeah I'd say so um and that's no um slight on what we thought of danam when he came in but it it's an absolute compliment to how well he's done I think he's been incredible for us you know I knew Dan was a very good player having played against him not myself but managed against him many times for for Brighton for various other teams um but I didn't realize quite how good he was until managing him uh seeing his Effectiveness and I think the added bonus with that was always the the Jordy perspective the love for Newcastle just gave him an extra um an extra layer really that we wouldn't have got from any other player signing in that position he's managed to keep his place in the team he's managed to develop into a real leader for us really strong personality on and off the pitch can't speak highly enough of how he conducts himself so I think he's been an outstanding signing for us I think the suggestions all that he's out of Contra here in the season but I'm guessing obviously you'd be Keen to see him stay much longer and what you've said there yeah I'm not I'm not sure on his contract situation to be honest that's my my uh my mistake so I'll have to go away and check that but I see Dan being a an integral part of what we're doing here thanks Jordan Chris more NY on Alexander isach is the tow fully healed now and is he in a position where he could theoretically start tomorrow yeah I think the toe's fully healed although we do have one training session to go so fingers crossed that that goes okay for him um but we said and we felt the the toe wasn't a big injury when he did it it was just one of those things that he couldn't tolerate the pain but now he feels in a lot better place he's trained well so yeah fingers crossed and on Brighton I mean there's been some suggestions that Newcastle may follow more closely a sort of similar model to them in the transfer market you've mentioned that obviously had to sell incuba Mina to them this Summer is that something that you can see happening is that a model that Newcastle are sort of looking at the way Brighton have done things being a PSR World um in what respect do you mean just in terms of the fact that obviously they seem to buy players young and be able to sell them for a large profit and I've obviously managed to get round PSR in that sense where they don't really have problems yeah I mean Brighton have been doing that for a long time they've they've got a really good model of recruitment I believe they're heavily reliant on data and they use data incredibly well we're not in that position at the moment um to do that they've got a unique way of finding young talents around the world um and they've had remarkable Success With It full credit to how they've done it and the people involved in that because it is very very difficult to do um and as you say they've reaped the rewards from that with huge transfer fees but also they've still managed to get results while while trading which is very very difficult so I think they deserve a lot of respect I'm sure there's a lot of clubs around the country looking at them thinking could we follow the same methods you have to be careful before following any team really you have to have your own route and um ours will be unique to us thanks Chris Luke it's interesting when you talk about your age how's it feel to be almost 50 something I'm in denial about Luke to be honest do do you consider yourself to be a veteran now oh don't don't don't don't um one extreme to the other no absolutely not I consider myself in my Prime but I I think I'd say that regardless of what age I am physical your Prime you're you're obviously not are you I'm obviously not no not been a long time um on England you gave them no real encouragement at all we were there in Germany when when your name was first linked with it you were always very very consistent in your message that you wanted to stay at Newcastle there is question absolutely yeah absolutely I'm trying to find the question but yeah absolutely um I I said in Germany right at the start when we most of you were in the room we had that inter VI my my focus was all on Newcastle that never changed for for one second where do you think where do can you see where you'll been in 5 10 years time could do you look that far ahead AB absolutely not no I I hope I'm managing in sort of some ways and then other part of me will think maybe I'll I'll not I'll be doing something different but you you you just don't know um I love the job I sort of love the challenges that come with it um but it is draining and it is a huge sacrifice on your personal life so there's there's always that balance that I'm sort of fighting internally but as long as I continue to enjoy it and I feel my family's in a good place then I'll happily um Carry On for as long as possible thanks Luke Lee Ryder then Scott Wilson morning Eddie um just on the Midfield you've obviously got a lot of options in there um trying to get it down to to three for a starting 11 but how are you going to keep those six or seven players happy this season season um yeah good question you never never quite know how that Dynamic is going to work um I think for those for those guys the competition for places is really really healthy for them although they will sometimes probably feel the frustration of that competition all they have to do is when the minute they take the pitch is try and make a difference try try and make a difference try and make me pick them for the next one um I think we saw a positive impact from both um Midfield substitutions against Everton Sean longstaff Joe Willet came on and did really well and gave us an extra lift and and that's the beauty from our perspective that you get not just good players starting the game but players that can hopefully come on and influence the result positively for you at the end of the game um we love all the players involved some of them have had different runs of form we will get injuries I'm sure and suspensions so we're going to need that strength throughout the season just going back to to sort of Dan burn Shan long staff I know you said you're not sure on the contracts but let's let's assume that they are going to expire soon do you want them to to be here in the next sort of few years yeah as I said with Dan I think Dan's contract is um maybe not as clear as I thought but I haven't got a definitive answer in my brain I think I think with any player that's out of contract it's all individual I don't think I could collectively say one way or the other I think you have to look at the individual and then you have to break down lots of various aspects it's never a clear do we do you want them to stay or not especially not in the modern world that we're in now with PSR and trying to navigate our way through that can be very very difficult and sometimes that can as we saw with yancer and Elliott that can make a decision go away from the football side to a financial side and that's that's really sad from my perspective but that's the the reality we in and that will of course influence our decisions as we um go through this year just on the sort of English managers um I was a bit surprised when I looked back that I think Harry rnap was one of the last English managers to win a trophy uh Steve McLaren um I know obviously you're desperate to try and change that but I mean is that something that will have to change in the eyes of the fa if they are going to look sort of Beyond an overseas coach yeah to a point but I I do think you have to look at the clubs being managed by English managers to sort of make that direct comparison really I think it's a dangerous thing just to look at the the trophies one because then you have to look at the clubs that are being managed by English managers and of course if you're different clubs you've got higher percentage of winning and I I don't think there's been that many English managers in charge of those clubs so um I just think the development of English managers is key the coaching courses the infrastructure to to help people get on that path um has improved probably still more to do um because it is something I'm passionate about thanks Le Scott just um Ed Eddie when you answer Damian's question you kind of said that it it'll be you know it's quite nice now that the England things put to bed you don't have to worry about it I mean it has been a season where right from the start of the summer really there's been a lot of external noise lots of stuff going on I mean I know you'll see internally you you you know you remain very focused I understand that but but would it would it be nice if if there wasn't you know as much kind of external chatter in the rest of the season as there probably has been up to this point yeah absolutely from my perspective I'd love it if you you guys could tighten down let's just talk about new car yeah I don't think the issue or the distraction is ever for me it's more the only people I really concern me is the Players so they read no doubt they will read stuff and hear stuff and it's what effect it has on them for me I know my own work ethic and standards and I know that it takes a lot to move me from anything that I'm focused on so it's more the players that are always the con and I know seems like we ask you this constantly but again Sven botman has been pour some kind of semi um positive updates of his training and stuff Ian is is there any chance we see him before the next International break in November or are we looking beyond that no we're looking beyond that right but he's hitting the you know the right strength markers he's looking really good we haven't seen him in training yet when we probably won't see him until after the next International break but he is closing in um um it is a a long road I know everyone wants sort of news we want him back he wants to be back but it's got to be at the right time again but the reality is we're probably looking more towards Christmas time cheers go to Craig and then to Martin morning Eddie if the fa had knocked on the front door would you have had a conversation with them not your front door to say I got Visions people turning off at my front door that's why I laughed um hypothetical questions are very very dangerous to answer and it it always seems to come from you Craig um so uh I'll talk to anybody who knocks on my front door but not in the respect of um entering conversations about leaving Newcastle uh what an English candidate out there you said you would have preferred an English candidate do you think there was one out there yes there of course there was candidates but I'm not going to critique the fa's decision I think their decision is to them and they know a lot more than I know um so they will have all the information and I don't think it's for me to judge that decision but of course there was people out there and people I think are very very good who are English and available um but I'm sure the fa did their work on that and they come to their decision thank you Martin Hardy hi Eddie is the England job still the ultimate job for English coaches uh I think if you if you're looking to get into International football and you've got that passion for International Football absolutely yes um but I think if you're I just think it depends on your Viewpoint if you're looking domestically and you love the day-to-day aspect of the job and obviously you'll have a different answer so I think it depends on your Viewpoint for me as a kid I loved World Cups I loved European championships I was obsessed with England trying to win something um and I I really do hope that Thomas is able to do that for the country and as you say the game changes day by day but there is a perception that one day you will be the head coach of England do you see do you see that do you feel that and is that an additional pressure on you no I don't I don't visualize that I I genuinely think about Newcastle and trying trying to lift the trophy here would be my goal um and I immerse myself with what I'm in currently um so no other thoughts have entered my head I can't remember the second Point second do sorry do you feel that as an additional pressure that people see your career path one day no no I don't see that I I don't take on that that feeling um I just Tred to do the best I can and and and how much work is there still to do in Newcastle how much work yes God loads starting as soon as I exit this room it never stops so we we've got a huge amount to do thanks Mar go to Louise and then Mark hi Eddie um if you ever decided one day yes I will walk walk away it's too much sacrifice on my personal life Etc what would you do what what do you envisage yourself as as doing well I had this thought after I left bartmouth and I thought right what am I going to do and loads of different things came into my head and I thought right let's see if I can actually do something else something useful and I didn't come up with much I hit a bit of a blank to be honest so um I ended up swinging quite quickly I think was about a few days back to football again so if would you ever consider taking a sabatical like like pep did you know going you went to New York for for a year and obviously traveled around has that ever crossed your mind would that be it's crossed my mind it crosses my mind um quite a lot um because I think when you're so intensely working you sort of often go to the the extreme the other way um no I don't I don't think I sort of had my break and I loved it and enjoyed it and I I felt I needed it but I think now I'm full steam into into the intensity of work and enjoying it um I don't think traveling is really up there for me I think my family is everything so it's it's time with them if I'm not working thank you thanks Louise markas uh Eddie you mentioned earlier about yanuba you you would have utilized his skill set are you surprised he's been a starter for Brighton and he's he's come that far that quickly uh no I wouldn't say I'm I'm massively surprised I watched him a lot last year I thought he he did very well well um The Challenge always when you come to the Premier League is it's different um the intensity the physical nature of the Premier League can often be a shock to players especially the younger ones but he's I think he's dealt with that really well and you can see from his early games that he looks super F looks really confident looks at home in the environment that he's in so full credit to him um and finally you you uh mentioned I think after the last International break it was quite difficult to get some of those players back to speed because they've been a long way is that something you envisage will be as much of a problem now or will it be less because you're further into the season hopefully less less of an issue I think players that have come back we got the the England guys back early so that that helps it wasn't like they were coming back yesterday or today um so the earlier of course you can get them back the more work you can get into them so but uh I think Bruno arrived back yesterday and his his is always a challenge migy they're always a challenge because the distance they have to travel so they're the guys that probably need the biggest help thanks Gary at the back morning Eddie morning um just a quick one on Anthony Garden obviously the last game yeah there was the penalty he went away with England played the first game was left out the second game have you have to like kind of put an arm around him this week has that affected his confident in any way or have you seen no difference in him at all no as I said Anthony was one of the players that we got back early um he had two really good days of training with us no I've seen no ill effects from anony he is very Resolute very strong doesn't give a lot away in terms of necessarily how he feels I think he's got that ability to move on quite quickly which is a real strength um he's a really important player for us we hope we can um continue to build on the momentum when you look back to the Manchester City game I thought he's outstanding playing as a central Striker thought he did well at Everton um so uh no issues in terms of his form for us thanks Gary Simon hi Edie um just interesting what he said to Luke about the pressures of of the job and the toll it can take on you does every manager have a shelf like at life at a club and how how long can you do it before needing a break and because the intensity that's an interesting question because I think there there probably is a shelf life um for every person at a club but I think it's Unique to them and the club I don't think you can put a Time on it to say well that's that's your length of time and you're done I think you look at Sir Alex Ferguson went on and on and on and managed to reinvent himself very cleverly over a long period of time and had the internal resilience and motivation to just keep going uh everyone's different I don't think you can put a label on it but I think sometimes you have a feeling within you that you you sort of can get to the point where you go I think my time here is is done certainly don't feel that for myself yet um and I hope I don't for for a long time okay thank you everyone just a point of clarity on a question earlier Dan bur is under contract next season okay thank you thank thank you that helps thank you cheers
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,zVdp5TbHtFg,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVdp5TbHtFg,"hi Eddie firstly can we check on a few players who've um got injuries or potentially have injuries um Alexander isach is's not in the Sweden Squad is there any chance he goes to Everton with you no unfortunately not no he won't make the game we hope he'll be back with Callum for the game after the international break that's the the plan at the moment so fingers crossed both players continue to do well and what about Nick Pope who is in the England squad but was missing the other night yeah should be okay Kieran trippier is he okay and available for you this weekend yeah we hope so yeah and um there's a few Fabian Sher as well I think you mentioned had a couple of took a couple of knocks against Wimbledon is he all right should be okay good I'll leave it there with injuries um the performance and the draw against Manchester City then progress in the cup if you can get a positive result at Everton it would make what's been a a good week even better wouldn't it and and that's the way you'll want to sign off before the Internationals yeah absolutely that's the the aim from our perspective I think it's been a good week um the Manchester City performance I think gave us real heart and showed again I think what we are capable of as a group um when we all play our best um the wiland game was was obviously going to be difficult and it was a different kind of game but still effective result and with through so yeah everything rests now on this game for us what type of performance what sort of quality quties will you need to show in an away game but but also against Everton the way they play yeah I mean I think um whenever you go there it's a it's a difficult game I think the the ground of course the last time I think we visit there um it's sort of got that feel that the the fans are involved in the game right from the off they're very close to the pitch so I think how you start the game how you uh impose yourselves on the opposition there is is hugely important so we want to be really positive in our approach um we got to lessons from the Fulham game in our last away performance we did for the Manchester City game but it's still relevant in my mind that we need to to make sure we're the Manchester City team and um yeah we learn our lessons from that game and lastly Anthony Gordon's been back there with you a couple of times now do you feel that the whole thing of him returning to Everton has maybe died down a bit and is perhaps not as tense as it would have been the first time he he returned to goodison park yeah I think I hope so and I think having been back there twice I think this will be his third time I think with each time I think it will get slightly easier for Anthony but still he's he'll be emotional he's he's human I think there'll be um lots of things going through him as as he plays the game but I think as long as he focuses on himself and just I thought he was excellent last week and leading the line for us I thought he was really good um on and off the ball a really important performance because you need your your focal point and attack to deliver certain aspects um that help the team so all I ask is he does that again Eddie just one on on Callum and and Alex you're obviously missing both of them tomorrow um but how much one are you looking forward to having them back at your disposal and how much are Newcastle are a different animal when they've got them both cuz it almost feels like they feed off each other a little bit or certainly they haven't in the past when they both been fit and available yeah I don't think they've been fit together for a sustained period for a long time and I think that's had a a negative effect on us as a team of course because they're two outstanding players but also I think for themselves they they almost need each other I think to help propel them to their best performances because there's nothing like that pressure of someone else either competing for your shirt or in some senses playing with you because I think when they've played together they've done really well together um orbe we haven't seen it as much as we would have liked so two hugely in infuential players as well off the pitch you know Callum we've spoken about many times his energy his positivity um Alex is a totally different character but they he has an aura about him and he's someone that I think we're a much better team when we have both players around us so very keen to get them both back and is that one of the reasons why you've kept Callum M and we've seen it with Kieran trip here as well when there's been interest in them from from other clubs you've made it clear you've wanted to keep keep them here is that because as well as what they do on the pitch they offer a lot behind the scenes as well if they are injured or missing for whatever reason well you have players I think that um add to the Dress room add to the the spirit of the group callum's definitely one of those people that um he's always laughing always but not not laughing in a in a negative way laughing in a in a really positive way he produces energy whenever he's in the room you notice him and you can't have enough people like that that galvanized the group but also he's a he's a serious guy he wants to win um he wants to achieve and he I know he's really serious about trying to help Propel Newcastle to win trophies and that drives Callum so for all those qualities and of course his playing ability when he's fit he's um he's an incredible player so we're determined to try and get him back fit and keep him fit for as long as possible thanks thanks Andy well NY uh straight in lots of talk about the stadium at the minute to move or to renovate where do you stand now I know I've asked you this question before have you changed your opinion or where do you stand right now well I think it's a difficult one for someone like myself who people will want to know my opinion but I'm not based with all the facts I'm not sort of hearing the pros and cons behind all the decisions I think my natural instinct was always to stay at St James's Park it's an incredible place to play football it's our home so to to sort of think about moving somewhere else feels um a little bit bit of a betrayal to somewhere that's served us so well um but we are well aware that as a football club we need to in increase our Revenue so people with more brain cells will make the decision um for the benefit of the long-term future of the football club and that's always the most important thing so um I could be swayed but just my natural instinct is to want to stay I won't ask you about that for another year or so anyway at the very very least I'm going to dredge up a quot of yours from a year and a half ago or so sometimes you have to remember what it's like to lose it motivates you came after the loss to Sheffield Wednesday in the FA Cup um you went on to qualify obviously for the Champions League after that do you think that Fulham loss that you've referenced will have a similar sort of effect on Newcastle this season or not I certainly hope so I think there's nothing worse than that feeling when you lose and when you haven't performed and you know the sort of loss was self-inflicted to to to a degree of course I thought film played well um but we have to look at ourselves I think sometimes when you have moments like that in games like that it does force you to change and rethink and reset and I always think th those things can sometimes be really powerful and for the benefit um but I don't want to feel that again for a long long time um there was a clip of Dan burn against Manchester City pressing the entire city defense it same it went a little bit viral I think I think someone even put the Titanic music behind it as well does that kind of sum up the work rate the commitment that is going to continue turning Newcastle United's performances around because I imagine you have you know seen the clip of of Dan pressing well I saw it live and I was thinking what's Dan doing up there but um I think I think he followed someone in and then just continued and i' I'd always stand and applaud that attitude um because that's what we need we need that it's almost a um a metaphor really for for how we want the team to play is standing and stepping forward and we're aggressive we're coming to try and take the game and so if that is a an analogy that helps anybody then um that's what we want the team to look like we spoke to Dan yesterday and he said he watched the Aston Villa game in the Champions League the other night against Bayern Munich and it was almost like a kick to him personally that you know he wants to get back there the club want to get back there I know you're a manager that likes to look for motivational techniques is the kind of the atmosphere the scenes at Villa Park the other night the perfect motivational technique for the end this season um yeah I mean what whatever floats your psychology for me that's that that wouldn't have touched me necessarily in the same way maybe it touched someone else I think for me it's I was trying and look at us and and try and find ways um to take to take the group forward and set new goals and to to focus on where we are now and where we want to be in the future um look credits Reston Villa for what they did last year and credit to them for how they're attacking the Champions League it is it is a very difficult thing to do with the amount of games that you have um but we're on our own journey and that experience we had last year was incredible we desperately want that again um but uh sometimes the pain of missing out on something again going back to your point earlier does drive you forward in different ways so we're having to use that motivation to to help us this year thanks Andy Nisha morning Eddie and we talked there about durn pressing I guess the whole press from the team was really impressive against Man City and I guess you want to build on that with your next Premier League game but it is harder away from home when you haven't got that crowd so how do you adapt to the challenge yeah um you're absolutely right it is harder because the energy that the crowd give us the the feeling sometimes you your sort of a player will be questioning whether he goes whether he doesn't um because every decision you make on a football pitch you have to try and get right sometimes it's taken away by the Roar of the crowd and they'll go and that that instinct served us so well at home away from home you of course the supports in the main with the the other team so um that's something we we're well aware of and I think tactically it's just about our delivery it's about a delivery of how we Implement our style in every game and and it's very different that every game every challenge is different every team we play against is different um I think we've seen us be effective even if we're not pressing it doesn't pressing isn't the b and end all sometimes there's there's a time when you have to play a different way but it's just being effective in whatever you do we all know Joe linton's been a huge part of the team he makes such a big impact but I think he is just a a booking away from a ban you have you talked to him about how he channels you know what he does so well but you know the discipline aspect as well yeah I've had many chats with Joe on on different things of course that would be one part of it we don't want to miss him you know losing him is is always very difficult and especially so early in the season it feels like uh too early to miss a player through suspension so it's something he has to of course control the ones that are are in his control sometimes with a tackle and you can be a second late you can get a booking you sort of accept that but it's the it's maybe the other ones that we need to eradicate from our game just finally for me Shawn Dy spoke highly of you in his press conference and I guess how do you find coming up against him and his teams over the years do you look forward to it or do you just think gosh this is going to be hard I think you look forward to every game because it's every game so different I think with sha and I I think we've naturally sort of had a lot of games against each other he he came in at Burnley when I left so we've sort of got that um always had that sort of History together and I think many good battles over the years he's someone that produces very difficult teams to play against I've got a huge admiration for that um I don't think you ever get an easy game against a Shawn D team very organized they they know their roles they know what their jobs are they're highly effective and we've learned to previous cost against his teams that if you're uh not effective in your defending or you're attacking um it' be a very difficult game than okay good luck thank you thanks d Daman Spellman hi Eddie um to you today since the PSG game does that remain the Benchmark or a reminder of where this club wants to be on a sustained basis yeah I think we'll forever remember that game and I'm sure a lot of people will remember that game as sort of The Benchmark of what we we want Knights at St james' Park to look like it a great performance goals against a high class opposition the atmosphere was on a totally different level um it was an amazing night and unfortunately for us it was sort of a a big a big memory one big highlight and that's the frustration for us because I think after that game we wanted to continue along the same vein and try and repeat that consistently it wasn't to be um and now it remains a memory and we want that memory to of course to live a long time but we want to create new memories and that's always um The Challenge when you're in my shoes is to try and inspire people and try and focus on everyone's energies to to get back there and as much as you you would have wanted European football again this year has the fact that they haven't have you have you felt the benefit of that in terms of the extra training ground time yeah I think it's still early days in that respect but yes I think there was a time last year where we were we were losing players from injury too regularly and then the games were were looming large for us and we got to a point where I think we're at Breaking Point really we had 11 players to pick from and we were asking those players to play week in week out well every two three days very difficult period for us and results ultimately suffered at the end um so I think probably November December will be the the time when maybe we might see the benefit of not being in Europe but I think that was still our wish and our aim to to get there so we're not sort of looking at it in that way if that makes sense thanks Daman go to Dom Shaw and then to Jordan having having been part of the champions league is it frustrating to watch it from afar this year yeah I think it's well it's a different format um which is interesting really I mean you look at it and I'm looking at it through the lens if we were there now and we'd love to be part of it I mean it's very interesting the first year of the new format and you're thinking you you're always thinking with a Newcastle hat on you know how would it look for us how would those games be um I try not to live in that world too long because then you think right we've got a game against Everton on Saturday so I think you have to understand in my world I'm always thinking of the next game I'll have half an eye on what's going on around Europe of course I will but it's not my primary focus and just on Callum is there a desire on his part to show that his best years and days at Newcastle aren't behind him yeah without a doubt I mean if you know Callum personally you'll know how highly motivated he is and it was one of the most impressive things when I first met him seems like a long time ago but I saw a really driven individual with high really high expectations of himself and this was when we first came together in the championship and since then his career's gone from strength to strength but he's not someone to ever settle or to ever you know think think Middle Ground he's got an elite brain and he wants to um be his best every day and he wants to uh he wants to play he wants to score goal he wants to that's what he lives for really so I think all those motivations are still running through him very strongly thanks Tom got a Jordan then Lee Rider uh morning he just on midweek Martin de braa came out half time how was how was he doing yeah Martin took a a nasty whack to his knee I think uh he had a scan the scan showed I think that was just bruising um hopefully so um whether he's fit for this game or not I'm not sure but it won't be a serious injury and just on Jo Lon and the yellow cards can he challenge that aggression does he need to challenge that aggression or do you almost just accept that's part of his game and he has to almost play play on the edge yeah I think you have to accept it to a degree because you can't have a Destroyer Ball winner brilliant of second balls DWS tackler you know that that force that he is in the middle of the pitch and not except sometimes he's going to miss time tackles and sometimes he's going to pick up yellow cards you can't have it both ways of course we don't want to lose him to suspension we will try and help him with it but as I say you can't have both and then just finally going back to that PSG game is is that the Benchmark for the way you want your team to play is that still the bench Benchmark it's funny because obviously I watched it live I I analyzed the game but I haven't seen it since you know once you sort of analyze the game proper you put it to bed um so I've got no idea how that looks in now like watching the game now I might look at it through different eyes at the time it felt like a great performance but um yeah I'm sure I mean obviously I've seen the goals again but you know because they get replayed but I haven't sort of gone back through the game thanks Jordan please hi Eddie um last season Jordan pford at the end of the game seemed to Revel in in that Victory and he always seems to try to set a certain temperature at goodison Park is that something that can motivate the players a little bit on this occasion I don't think we need any extra motivation in a sense that we know last year that was a a painful defeat at a time when we were in the midst of the the season that we were going to have you know um that was a difficult night for us I think we felt the pain of the defeat so no we we know that it's just focusing on our performance in the game we don't worry about individuals it's about making sure we're at our very best tomorrow and we think it's going to be the last visit to go Park um how how will you feel going there potentially for one last time in front of a full house I think I feel fine um looking forward to the game you know it's not it's not the big deal for me it will be forevert of course um and I understand that but for me it's just trying to get the three points is the only important thing just on we watched last night um Tottenham uh play a lot of their young players I guess you would want to play more young players at Newcastle you've had a few success stories with leis Miley is that something a challenge to the academy to provide you with more options moving forward um yeah I wouldn't put it that way I think we're working in tandem with the Academy I think Steve Harper I've got a really good relationship with um I've been down to the academy a couple of times in recent weeks to spend some time with the staff you know we I think it's in great hands I think some really passionate people some great coaches down there and I think the work is taking place to try and produce future Superstars for Newcastle and I think everyone wants the same thing and it has done you know you look at the players that have come through in recent years when you look at Elliot and Louis Miley there's been some outstanding individuals you those players are they're elite players so I think it's done really really well of course the challenge is to produce more always people want more I want more um but the work's going on and as I say as long as we have the the right people in the right positions the players will come come through I've got no doubt about that thanks Lee got a Chris W and then Luke Edwards Chris more Eddie uh next week is going to be the three-year anniversary since the Takeover and I know you've not been here for the entire time but you have been for most of it during that time what progress do you think has really been made on and off the field how would you view those three years yeah it's is some somewhat difficult to me to judge before um because obviously before I didn't see before the Takeover I mean um so I think you guys will have a better maybe Judgment of that I can only talk about since I've been here and the support we've had internally has been brilliant from everyone at pif to the owners um and I think there's been a a big change when you look at just the environment the room we're sat in now that doesn't happen by chance that happens because of investment and the investment here at the training ground's been been there for everyone to see and of course there's a lot of work going on with stadiums and uh discussions about taking the club into sort of a next phase of that takeover I think the next phase of investment which will be the long-term growth of the club and that's really the the key decisions and I know that's why everyone's taken the time to try and make sure those decisions are right um but I think it's a really exciting time to be associated with Newcastle I think there's a lot going to happen in the future um the dreaded words of PSR and and that would just put a lid on what can be done now um but I think the future looks very bright beyond that period And I mean the team themselves has obviously made giant strides in terms of where they are in the table but you've used the word elite quite a few times in this press conference how far do you think you are from being one of those sort of established Elite footballing sides yeah I think we've got work to do we we're not there yet I think um we're well aware of where we currently stand you know when you look at revenue and wage bills and all the things that are sort of really key markers of long-term and consistent success we're not there so we can't sort of put that pressure on the players that we have now that'll be unfair on them to to um sort of restrict them in that way I want them to play with freedom and enjoy their football and to try and take the pressure off them now that doesn't mean that we don't push them hard for for winning and for the maximum of their capabilities which we will do but I think we have to recognize where we currently are and that's we're striving to get there we're not 're certainly not there yet thanks Chris Luke um callum's ability's never been in question um the problem is he's barely kicked a ball for you this year are you confident that he can stand up to the riggers of Premier League football at the age he's at yes I am I mean I I believe I believe in our our medical team and I believe in our Sports Science team and I believe in how we work so I think we can with the best will in the world you can never predict but I think we can get him fit keep him fit and he can be effective in the Premier League for us hopefully for some period of time to come um but there's no guarantee on that you you can't make promises that you you're not in control of but I see no reason why we can't I think he has everything that he needs here um I know that there's the the same desire from the player so when I think when you have that process of work and the desire from the player I'd like to think we can align together and he can continue to score goals for us I'm a little bit under the weather today so I might be a bit grumpy with these questions but you had a bit of a shocker s like you no I'm normally very Sunshine um you had a bit of a shocker at Everton last year and it was kind of indicative of um that's one way put weren't you ill pardon you were ill weren't you didn't you have Co yes uh did I have Co I was that the year before I'm not sure it all goes into sort of a blur but yeah don't think I was very well no okay um there was a problem with the away form last season and that that was I'm getting there roundabout way um are is the away form still a concern to you is it a concern to you that some players play a lot better at home than they play away what was the link to me being okay just cuz I'm not well just trying to understand it um yeah I think you want me to ask it again no no no please don't um I think I think you could make that I don't know whether it's an accusation or an opinion like we we have to accept what we deliver and I think you could quite fairly throw that at me um it's up to the players to respond to that I think certainly there's from my side there's no difference really with how we prepare the game with how we try and get the team to play so for me my side is about giving the the players the environment to play well the opportunity to play well um I'd like to think that's there and then it's down to the players to to deliver the performance that they we know they're capable of I think if you go back rewind historically I think our away form was very good in our Champions League season we were pretty consistent um I think one or two off games but I think that will happen through the season last year this sort of came to the four and then this year who knows what will happen I think we've won one drawn one lost one so we're very much in our hands to take it in a different direction and change the narrative and that's what we've got to try and do just finally um we had progress on Anthony Gordon's contract what's the situation with Alexander isach and sha long staff as well please I don't know to be very Frank with you um yeah I don't know thanks Luke go to Dominic skirt and then Craig just to follow up um Luke's question just Anthony Gordon is he one of those individuals who seems to thrive playing at James's part but maybe is less effective away from home yeah I don't think it's me for me to talk individually I I'll do that with the players themselves I think the challenge is for us all to be the same St James's Park and away from home it's not about individuals and it's about allowing sometimes one part of the team can affect the individual so it's about making sure as a team we're absolutely on it this weekend and he's a player who seems to thrive on the emotion of the atmosphere St James Park did it against Man City the situation with Everton Last Visit to goodison Pok do you think that could almost help him and Galvanize him this weekend yeah difficult to predict I think as I said earlier he will be he's a human being so he will be emotional going into the game all the players are emotional going into the game that because they're representing the football club and they're in a heightened state of emotion at that moment when you're playing I just want to see Anthony play his game thanks C n this is an extension of what we spoke about before with regards to the away form but and this is a compliment at your best when you followed you guys away from home he didn't look like in a away team you just looked like Newcastle you went out and played your game this season then the part of last you've looked like in a away team would you agree with that and what does that come back to I wouldn't totally disagree with it whether I agree with it I'm i' need time to process it um okay L you give me a little bit more thinking time um yeah I I just think we want to be the same team home and away we we don't the no part of us wants to send a team out and you sort of recognizing we are playing away from home so we want to see the same energy the same determination to take the game by the scuffer than they can dictate play I think if you look at the the top teams historically in the Premier League that's what they've done you look at the man City's in recent years they're always the best team to look at for me they they don't change and that's a compliment that they grab the game they're in control of the game and you wouldn't know whether they're playing home or where and that's a target for us to try and hit and for whatever reason we've been inconsistent um doesn't mean it's all bad there's been some really good in there but we need to find that consistency and will tomorrow be more informative of where your team is at because there's a lot of plaud it and rightly so after the game last Saturday against Manchester City but that's Manchester City at home will tomorrow tell you more and everyone more about whether your team is back whether that you know those qualities that identity is there to stay yeah I think I get your point Manchester City in itself takes care of itself the players will be elevated because of the opponent but you still have to perform in the manner that we did and that's not a given so I give the players credit for last week but this is another test where we have to respond in the right way thanks great got to Gary and then Kieran morning morning um just going back to the anniversary SP PSG for me for me um the best well yeah that been the best moment for for me from the Takeover was getting sort of appointed in the job I think um that that was a a great moment for me personally I think if it's Associated to a game the game against Leicester always sticks in my head that that Bruno's header um cuz that that stage we were I mean it's I'm going back a while but we were very much in relegation trouble and that just felt like a the moment we felt we were staying up um and it was at home and it was the last second of the game there's no better feeling than winning a game in those last few moments it just felt like a sort of a turning point for us so that game always sticks to my head and just last one from may obviously to another International break coming up is it frustrating for you that most e squad's going to be going off again or are you kind of happy that it's two week break after the the game get a couple more players players back no I think I'd prefer to keep the players here um I just feel we're beginning to get us in a better place physically collectively everyone on the same the same page everyone near enough 100% fit um to win the players that are fit here and then they go again and you lose contact with them for for two weeks which then in some senses if they don't play brings you back to back a couple of steps but the bonus is as you say hopefully we get not just Callum and Alex fit but Louis Miley as well who's been a big Miss from our Squad so to get those three players back in the next two weeks will be huge for us thanks Gary Kieran k um morning you spoke how it would feel maybe a betrayal to leave St James's but obviously mentioned the revenue aspect do you sense how delicate decision this is for the people above you absolutely I think it's well it's a massive decision because it will affect the next how many years at the football club and I think it was a decision that will you won't be able to please everybody there'll be different opinions but it's truly only the people that are sort of assessing all the the pros and cons can really make the decision it's very easy to give an opinion on the outside but until you know all the facts it's it's very difficult so you got a huge thing on on the cost and and against the reeven or the extra Revenue you could get so it's a it's a huge decision to make and you've obviously manage all over the country what makes it so unique as an arena I've always said the positioning for one the positioning where it is in the city is totally unique and I'd hate to see the stadium move from from its current position because it dominates the the eyeline of the whole city and it you can see it from from miles around and I think that's really inspiring when you wherever you are in Newcastle you get a glimpse and personally I always think to the next game and when we're going to be there um and then I think when you're in it I just think it's uh I don't know how it creates it but just the atmosphere the the look of the stadium I just think it's it's a beautiful thing and uh I love being there I love experiencing games there and obviously I love winning there that's the the best feeling thanks kieren Simon bird Eddie Eddie um the clubs has moved forward a lot in the last three years since the Takeover um but there was a lot of promises of winning things in five five years winning everything within five to 10 years were they unrealistic um and was the early optimism a little bit overblown and there wasn't a recognition of how hard it is to win stuff in football five years does seem short doesn't it especially you're in my shoes um I think at the time I don't think the statements were were rash I I think there was a feeling that the club at that stage could really invest what it wanted and there's no guarantee even with that investment you're going to win things we we all know that I think we've been in the in the game long enough but gives you a much better chance but since then I think there's been a real tightening of the rules and I think that's been unfair to judge them by those comments with with the changing of the rules because you only judge the comments by the the time they were made um and I think now it's become I wouldn't say impossible but it's become very very difficult to achieve I think what they initially thought they could achieve through no fa of their own the other one is on on the stadium Redevelopment is this the biggest test of long-term ambition for the club in terms of what the club's going to do with st james' Park whether it relocates or redevelops and specifically how it's a difficult question for you but how big do you think St James's Park needs to be I mean 65,000 as mentioned 880,000 if you could conjure a figure Co um I think Conjuring a figure is difficult but I think what you'd say is the demand is there so I think you could almost have whatever size Stadium you want to a degree and it would be full which I think whenever you build a stadium you don't you don't want to see empty seats you want to see the stadium full of people and I think when you go back to the game on Tuesday against AFC Winward and you see a soldout venue you can see the appetite here not just here but from Newcastle fans all over the world to come and watch the team play which is a a magnificent start starting point really um I think it's just such a difficult decision to say well this is the blueprint of the ambition because I don't think it that sort of simplifies the decision I'm not party to those talks I haven't been party to those talks at all but can only imagine sort of the detail they're going through to try and make sure they make the right decision for the long-term benefit of the club Thanks Martin anything sorry just just to go along with that how unique is is the stadium for you and for the players yeah I think it is I I I always said when I was an opposing manager coming to St James's Park the first time I managed there I was like wow that's I've never managed in a stadium quite like that now I think it did help that we won the game um because you always have positive memories on a win um but it it and I'm not lying here this is me and my staff talking and we'd been to every ground in the Premier League I think near Enough by that point and St James's part was one of the last I think we've been to and it is yeah blew us away um it's not necessarily the biggest there's just something about the the look of the stadium and the feel of it I think when you're there it's just a great place to to play football so if the club was to move they would lose something special yeah possibly but then I think you have to look at what you can gain um you can't just look at what you're going to lose what you could gain could also be equally as as special um and the club has to move forward it can't it can't be stuck in in the past or be romantic to a degree there's finances to think of and that will affect the long-term success of the club so that's why it's it's not a clear-cut decision"
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,43tzkbMFrzQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43tzkbMFrzQ,morning Eddie um can we start with a a check on some potential injuries please firstly how's Kieran trippier today yeah we're waiting to see um he felt okay yesterday but uh we're unsure whether he's going to be fit for tomorrow and is there no chance that we'll see Alexander isach tomorrow night no he won't be fit for the game and I think Sandra tanali came off with cramp was it on on Saturday how is he yeah I believe it was cramp um again he's a a player that we'll make a late decision on today we need to always with two days after the game can can be the time when little things come forward um injury-wise um so we'll make another assessment this morning but in any case would this have been a match a cup tie an opportunity for you to change things around use your squad and give some players who've not had a lot of football the chance to start yeah I think we will um see as an opportunity to um get game time for those that um maybe haven't but in saying that still pick a very strong team and ultimately of course we need to pick a team that we think can take us through to the next round this is a vitally important game so our preparation will be the same as it would be for a Premier League game we'll take it um absolutely seriously and try and produce another good performance we saw about 10 minutes of William osula at fham um a week and a half ago could this be the the right sort of opportunity for him maybe to play from the start possibly um assessing our options we're we're of course we're lighting the center forward area um I thought Anthony did really well on satday was really pleased with his commitment to the to the role his Endeavor and his pressing I thought was was incredible and I think that gave us a really good um route into the game in terms of our press and our intensity going back to the levels that it has been historically uh we really like will I think he's settled in really well um he's training well behind the scenes with developing his game in lots of different areas so uh yeah I'll have to make a decision on the team this was supposed to be an away tie for you but after everything that happened to AFC Wimbleton last week how much are you looking forward to welcoming them and hosting them yeah we are I mean it's um not every day that the you know what happened has happened you know we switched um the venues um but of course as I said before I think uh on Friday we wish them well and we hope that they get their ground back to a level where it can host games very soon um for us we take the game seriously whether it's home or away um you know they've started the season very well very strong team they've got really uh good attributes in their play very very good from set plays uh really really strong um very well organized defensively they've been excellent in their own League this year they've been watertight um so we've got a challenge to um of course break them down and to create chances but also nullify their physical strength thank you Nisha morning Eddie uh Razer touched on it there giving a chance for players who haven't had minutes to play I just wondered about Miguel almeron how how has he been with not getting minutes and is this potentially an opportunity for him migy would be like the every other player in the squad that wants to play um wants to influence wants to make a difference with his qualities um yeah mig's uh really highly valued by all of us I think it's been it's been difficult to get him the minutes that that he would crave early season but this is a a big moment for him to show his qualities um you outstanding player and outstanding athlete someone that's made made a huge contribution to our success in recent years um and someone we'd love to see play well just reflecting um a bit on the man city game is there a sense of relief that that performance that you were waiting for it it finally came uh I think there's always a feeling of well loads of different emotions going into every game before and after that was a it was an intense period in the leadup to the game we as I said last week we had a a strong sort of reflection on our start to the season I think we are very honest with each other players and and staff um we know what we're capable of and that was much more like ourselves against Manchester city was a great um environment created by the supporters I think we Rose to that occasion and now the challenge is to find that consistently and to to try and hit um those individual performances and Collective performances on a consistent basis you mentioned there how important the cups are I guess have you um have you had a really strong talk with the players because you obviously made the final a couple of seasons ago and where the club is and where they could finish in the Premier League obviously the cups are the main chance of silverware really yeah strong word with the players I think we we set our objectives out early season uh preseason really um in terms of where we want the squad to be and I think where I want the squad to be is regardless of our opposition regardless of the competition the attitude is the same we we attack the game um we show we want to win and we have to deliver all the fundamentals towards that objective I'm not the type of manager that will sort of prioritize games every game is hugely important I don't think you can and prioritize games um of course we want to get through we want to win and we want to win well and we want to play well um that's always the challenge and just finally for me in terms of giving minutes to players that haven't played does that apply to your goalkeepers as well because obviously there are a few and we've seen Nick Pope this season will it be an opportunity for for your other goalkeepers to play potentially we'll have to make the right decisions we'll have to get the balance right of the team as I said um it's it's a blank canvas really I'll look at it and try and pick the right players for this game thank you good luck thanks daa Daman Eddie just talking about the keepers there I mean is it is it a querk of the situation you found yourself in the summer that you've ended up with so many goalkeepers who are competing for that that like black adamus hasn't hasn't made the match their squad yet is is is that one of the difficulties of the position you found yourselves in um I think it's fair to say that it's quite unusual to have that number of established goalkeepers and we have that position but I think we found last year to our cost you know injuries to goalkeepers can be you know can have a really detrimental effect on your season so look we've got the strength and depth in that position we'll um enjoy having that strength and um all the goalkeepers are training well their attitudes have been excellent they're all supporting Nick at the moment who started the season and started the season very well so um I'm enjoying seeing you know that battle for places uh and as Nisha mentioned two seasons ago you made the final in this competition was was that run did that sort of reinforce the belief that this club can do something special over the next few years yeah I mean I think it was you know the early rounds were very difficult that that season and I think we survived difficult to think back to all the rounds but I think we survived the penalty shootout within that very fine margins we managed to battle our way through a couple of difficult um difficult rounds and then I think it built up and I think you get to the quarterfinal the semi-final was you know the semi-final two games were really memorable for us then of course you've got a a chance to win a um a trophy so I think the early rounds are hugely important you can't take anything lightly we know how difficult every game is so uh this is really where you set the the opportunity to potentially win a trophy so we take tomorrow with the utmost importance thank team got Lee ryer and then Dominic more Eddie um on on wi Wimbledon I mean obviously you've got them up here and showed them some Hospitality with the with the ground where does that Hospitality sort of [Laughter] end well I think um the most important thing from our perspective is the players are professional and uh we don't underestimate anybody and I certainly don't because of my background you know when we were um in League one League 2 and our early coaching days these were unbelievable opportunities to test the team that we had then against the team from a higher league and all the rewards that came with that both financial and for the for the players so I know how motivated wimon will be for this um um we need to make sure there's no um come down really from the Manchester City game because they're Polar Opposites in terms of games you couldn't get more contrasting but what needs to be consistent is as I said earlier is our attitude and our performance level so that's what we'll be looking for the players to deliver just in terms of your preparation I mean obviously I'm sure you are prepared but the fans give them some insight on how much research you do into it I mean do you know as much about the Wimbledon right back as you do about Kyle Walker or someone like that at Man City well it's a a little bit more difficult because of course with someone like K Walker you'll come up against him historically and you'll build a a better understanding of course from from playing against these players on a consistent basis uh I think I said again on Friday that one of the beauties of being in the same league as um great players and great coaches is hopefully with every game you play against him you you you find out a little bit more about your team or whether it be a tactical point I think this is one of the beauties of this game is it's a one-off game and um our detailed analysis is is brilliant we have a team of people that um une Earth everything that we we feel is relevant to our preparation I will always watch the opposition several times regardless of how well I know them because teams change um but of course with this situation it's about finding out about wimon really and um as I said they've started the season very well um they've been hugely impressive and we're going to need to play well and just on the goalkeepers obviously Nick Pop playing the last round at notam Forest what what what's your sort selection policy going in into this game does someone else come in because it's lower league um I we take it game by game is it's not a set format for a competition it's what's going to be the best thing for the squad for the players um and for the team so that's the decisions that we'll try to make thanks Lee Dominic morning Eddie you touched on him last week but Matt targy um his situation could he be back available for you tomorrow no I don't think so I think it's a little bit too early for Matt he's still very early stages of training um at the moment he feels good um but I don't think he'll make this game he was close to playing a month ago he played on the pitch just behind you um back in August out first spell again almost a year out just how difficult is it being firm this this past 12 months yeah it's been tough for Matt because I think you know previous to those spells out had been a really reliable performer for us he'd been um someone who' come in during a relegation battle and and really solidified that left back position he was someone that um consistently played to a really high level um very very um consistent really good professional so this has been a really difficult time for him with without a shadow of a doubt that the time that he spent injured has been hugely frustrating for him and for us because we've missed a very very good player um you know Matt is technically for me one of the best players in the squad um so we've really missed him we'd love to get him back fit on a consistent basis the last problem that he's had is um has been a difficult one to take on top of the other episodes that he's had so fingers crossed now we can get him back for a sustained period thanks up got Craig and Chris there was a lot of talk last season players got injured com back recurring injuries obviously been changes Above This James believe that is at one of one of those the return play progam Alex is there a concern dang wasn't good where was he yous injury injection everything else yeah no I I don't think that would be the case I think it was those situ one of those situations where if he could tolerate the pain he'd be fine um and I think he tolerated the pain for as I said I think it was about 80 minutes of the game before he became aware of any feeling back in that toe um but it was it was either going to be was going to be out for probably until after the international break initially or he could carry on playing as normal if he could tolerate the um the feelings and the effects of the injury now he hasn't been able to do that so we're back to the original diagnosis I think possibly yeah will as well can you just tell us the back to when he came in thinking what you saw in him how close is he now to be tomorrow to be the Premier League as well yeah I think as I say all the time with new signings there is a process these players have to go through depending on their respective Pathways and how they get to this point so with will he's come in and we were well aware that we would have to go to work as as coaches and will would have to go to work as the player to um develop himself to improve every are of his game to become a premier league striker we we feel he has the attributes to do that um very very quick physically excellent um obviously his tall imposing character is probably his best asset is running in behind and stretching the line for us um he's got some things to smoothen out in his game um but we've seen already certainly from the battles he's had against our Center Ares in training um he has an ability to score goals and he has the ability to uh have a physical impact in the game and really make it uncomfortable for Defenders so we're working hard with him he's working hard himself his attitude's been excellent comes in with a big smile on his face every day so um his career in his game I think it's going in the right direction thanks Craig Chris then K more Eddie you mentioned that Alex is likely to be out till after the international break what's the time scale for Callum Wilson's return will he be back after the international break yeah I mean with Alex with not ruled him out we're sort of assessing him um on a daily basis because there is a chance he could be fit for Everton um if everything falls into place of course then we have a decision to make does he play that game or do we leave him knowing that it'd be okay two weeks afterwards um Callen Wilson's on track to be fit for after the international break along with hopefully Louis Miley um just thinking I've left anyone out no I think I think that's pretty much where we are with those guys and of course Fen and Jamal are a little bit further back but hopefully some good news on the horizon but until they're back fully it's it's difficult to promis that and how much have you lost by not having this sort of competition between Alex and Callum because obviously we saw towards certainly the back end of the 2022 23 season how much they they push one another how much are you looking forward to hopefully having that back soon yeah I think it's been a a dynamic that we have certainly missed um and I think the players have missed themselves almost last year they were dovetailing one was fit one was missing out and we never sort of got the strength of having both available I think there was you might tell me differently but the Burnley game sticks in my head towards the back end of the last season we had them both and used them both and they were excellent together but um it's a dynamic that we we need and I think the players need um whether that's for rotation so they're both fit and fresh when they play or whether it's the competition because two outstanding players fighting for one role can only benefit um the performances I think thanks CH K morning Eddie um Anthony Gordon has said he does not need any persuad to stay here um how important after a difficult summer is it for Newcastle to keep key players like that yeah I mean that's a a nice thing to hear I think it's hugely important I've said many times how important it is that we keep our current players fulfilled happy um and I think we can do that a number of ways of course you know the main way for me is to keep progressing and improving and the am the ambition of the club remains really strong I think players if they can see that will will commit their Futures because they feel we're we're going in the right direction as a club um Anthony's best years are ahead of him I think he proved again on Saturday how how good he is and how good he can be um still feel there's more to come and also the versatility that ability to play different attacking roles can only serve us well with the a small Squad that we have so I was delighted with him I was delighted with the love that he got from the supporters that feeling and that bond is so important so uh really big thank you to the supporters for that I suppose one way a club can show ambition is in the trans amk maybe with a a big name arrival do you feel key players like that can still see the ambition as as you say well that's important that we show that and I think players need to feel that we are continually improving and what is a league that is always improving and never standing still so that's certainly something for us to um think about and consider as we uh you know continue through different transfer Windows thanks K Tom Shaw hi Eddie just on Alex will will he be going away with Sweden still well that'll be a decision that we'll have to make um depending on how he looks coming into the the international break I presume though give him what he's going through at the minute you prefer he didn't would that be fair to say it all depends on if he's fit or if he's not fit um fers crossed he can be and he can be involved against Everton and then he can go with his international team just ask one on Lewis Hall how much has he come on over the course of the last 12 months and what does he have to do to take his game to the next level yeah he's done really well I've been really pleased with Lewis I think like I said earlier there's always a process and sometimes I understand supporters of media that they want sort of instant results um someone that you sign you want to instantly see them on the pitch um but it's our job to make the right decision for the player and for the team and sometimes that means a process where you take the player away you do a lot of work with them and try and get certain aspects of their game to the level you feel required so going back to willla there's um a lot of work going on every single day with him but most importantly you've got to have the the raw ingredients and the right the right player to develop um Lewis was excellent last year behind the scenes his attitude to his work was was very very good and no doubt he would have had frustrating days and disappointing weeks but I think he's seeing and reaping the benefits of that now because I think his game's in a really good place I would argue that's probably his best performance for for us since he's arrived at the club against Manchester City I thought he looked composed really composed with the ball made some very good decisions um and defended really well against worldclass players in a lots of potentially difficult situations I thought he navigated some um situations really really well so very pleased with him um but it does go to show there's no substitute for hard work and coaching I'm a big believer in that uh in that area thanks up go to Gary and then Martin morning Eddie just going back to Anthony G since Saturday obviously as well quite a few say you know Jo how we could say taking over Harry Kane England where do you see Anthony Gordon in four five six years time it in positionally you mean yeah um I'd probably still say his best position is as a left Winger um currently if if someone were to say give me that question that you have but he can and does have the ability to play different roles number nine being one of them and he can play it very very well um but it is different for him and I think you could see a few moments on Saturday where he's receiving the ball totally square with his back to goal that's a diff totally different skill to receiving the ball side on like he does as a Winger um and you would need work and time to develop those skills which I'm sure he could if trained there on a consistent basis but I think he has so many great skills as a Winger you know his ability to play One V one his decision- making in wide areas is as good as there is I think in the Premier League in my opinion so we got to be careful before changing that too much you seem relish responsibility on Satur as well you'll know a lot better than most he's got all the skills in the world but mentally is he ready to Club country I think he's shown that mentally you know last year because very difficult in this league to be consistently good um because teams will work you out or try and come up with plans against you and then you've got to find a solution to those plans so Anthony's done that very very well I think um mentally he's really matured in my opinion since he's come here just the natural process of playing every week and international call-ups naturally you go through that it's not easy to survive in those worlds you you've got to be really mentally tough to do it and um I've been hugely impressed with how he's adapted to all the challenges that he's faced and no doubt will'll continue to have but he's his personal life is in a you know really stable healthy position that helps him he's got a really tight-knit family and really good support group which when he needs advice he can turn to and they certainly help him um be able to perform at the level that he's at thanks Gary Martin Hardy hi Eddie Anthony like a few others was linked with moves away from the club in the summer and I think you've touched upon it about about how that could that was a difficult period for them and perhaps for the for the squad how important was it to reset and refocus him yeah I don't necessarily think there was a sort of a resetting moment or a refocusing moment it was more I think for Anthony getting the fitness that he had missed um as I said the the summer was difficult for him because not only did he not play in the Euros that that has a physical cost you know he hadn't played for a long long period of time then he had a really short preseason with us so last week we did a lot of work with him and he he looked a lot better for that and we're continue to do that um yes he had the two games with England this time during the international break which would have helped him so I think it was more that than the any transfer speculation and do you see him as an England regular um I don't think it matters what I think to be honest it's about the England manager and what team he picks but certainly he's doing himself no harm currently and and with his last performances with England where I thought he was very good and a slight change of tack track um you mentioned about being a League 2 manager what's the biggest difference between being a premier league manager and being a League 2 manager and what's the biggest thing you miss from those days I think it's you lot that's the biggest difference to be honest um certainly a lot more a lot more scrutiny I think and a lot more um yeah a lot more uh sort of outside noise the job it's s is always about you and the players regardless of what level you're at is you coaching the players helping the players try and produce their best performance in a weekend that part of it I think is very very similar but everything around it is totally different what do I miss um I think I I probably that there's a it's a much smaller Circle I think when you're um uh in League two and League one and you're building your way up I think you you have a lot smaller staff you have a lot um more time with the players really because here there's a lot of support stuff with unbelievable job and help the players in so many different ways but because of that you lose some contact time so it's it's probably that that I I miss the most what you going to say short quiet press conferences there well I couldn't say that I'd said it I'd alluded to it I didn't want to go the whole hog the to finish hiie um with with Anthony Gordon back in the back in the summer in the Eur when all the Liverpool stuff was going and this Professional Medical in leig was talked about were you in contact with Gareth Southgate I mean did you have some Chats on the phone about what was going on and and handling him no no no no chats with Gareth Gareth had a enough on his plate um I think that story not that I paid too much attention to it but was slightly overblown um in my knowledge of it um so I think Anthony was fine and I think Gareth was was fine and um you must have been alarmed when he fell off his bike his electric bike in the when he was yeah I was I was alarmed when I saw the the pictures and but I think in those moments I've always said that I try and leave the players alone I try and let them concentrate on the work that they have and the tactical information they're getting from their national team manager is much more valuable than me getting in the way so of course asked about Anthony's welfare after that fall off the bike it was a slightly unusual one
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,VJZXtktyl58,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJZXtktyl58,"good morning Eddie uh firstly can we just check on injuries have you got any fresh problems anyone who's been out closer to returning this weekend no I don't think we have anyone coming back that's been out Matt target has had a um flare up of of exma so he's been sort of nursing that for the last couple of weeks it's been quite a bad um episode for him so we're hoping to get him back training today but he won't be involved in the game um and then we got the long-term injured yeah um in terms of fresh injuries Alex is is still nursing that toe problem the postponement of the Cup tie in midweek was beyond yours and wimbledon's control um in terms of your schedule and training and preparation for a big week um what impact did it have for you um well of course it gave us the opportunity to train which was probably a good thing for us um two really good days where we've gone to work with the team and to try and solve some some of the issues from the Fulham game so I look at that as a positive I think whatever situation you're in if we had the game it would have been a positive if we didn't we we always try and look at the the positive outlook on the situation so um pleased with the work that we've done um and yeah we're looking for a better performance Wimbledon are coming here now next Tuesday I'm sure you've seen that a a fundraising uh attempt to help them repair their pitches past more than £100,000 and Newcastle United made a significant ific contribution to that which I'm sure you'll um you know be really proud about the fact that they've tried to help yeah absolutely I think that's where the football Community does so well for each other because that support is vital I mean you look at the pitch there looks looked in a really bad way had no idea until sort of minutes before my press conference of the situation um but yeah we wish them well and we hope their pitch gets back working very soon you referred there to some of the issues in the performance had follow when you've had the chance to look back at it and analyze everything have you reached any new conclusions compared to what you felt at fulltime yeah lots of conclusions um there was one of those games you look back and you see you always have an instant opinion that's why it's very difficult when you come and speak to the Press straight after a game because you have sort of your initial thoughts and then you of course you watch the game again and sometimes the game reveals itself in a totally different way I think it was one of those games where we we analyzed a lot took away a lot from it uh to try and um Implement into our game so it was one of those games I think where you review and you think now that we we didn't like ourselves so some honest conversations this week and hopefully a response and how much given the performance at follow and some of the criticism from fans about the way you've played this season do you feel that in such a big game this weekend that you you need to deliver a big performance I think we always need to deliver I think there's always that pressure but yes I do I think we have a responsibility to show our true selves to turn up and give our best that that that feeling is always there from from me and from everybody I think the players know they're very honest with themselves as well I think they know that last week wasn't good enough so um that internal reflection can be really healthy and sometimes a performance like that can be actually healthy for the long term if you use it in the right way that's what we're trying to do and finally that's something that you have done in the home games against Manchester City isn't it last season in the league with a really stretched Squad you almost got something you were leading for a long time you won The League Cup tie at St James's last season and the three3 draw two years ago which was bit of an epic game wasn't it yeah we I think we've had some really good games against them uh at home maybe not so much away um but reflecting on those games that you're talking about there were sort of nearly moments for us um especially in the last home game where we felt we did a lot right but didn't get the result and that's probably Testament to them and their quality and their attitude the way that they fought to the end and scored a a goal in the dying seconds but I think it shows that against that type of quality opposition that Manchester City possess you have to be good for the whole 95 minutes however long the game is you can't switch off for a second defensively we're going to have to be very good in this game thanks Matthew Nick hi Eddie you said there had been some um internal reflection have you sensed the determination from the players this week to try and put that that fullham defeat right yeah I do I sense um an acknowledgement from everybody me included everyone in it together that last week wasn't good enough it wasn't a great reflection on our style our way of playing so I think you have games like that most important thing is that they're they're an absolute minimum and you learn from it and you come back and show how good you are I mean they don't come much bigger against the Champions it's um it's it's a it's a tough fixture I wonder could it be the the perfect fixture in some ways um perversely to try and correct what happened last weekend um I think that's again how we have to look at it I think the next fixture is hugely important for us after that kind of game so um I think everyone will be highly motivated for the match I think the crowd will be really there for us um if we can Inspire them um and we need to make it as difficult as we can for our opponents and we can only do that if we're at our very best last one from me edit one of the key talking points uh could be a key area of the pitch tomorrow this Midfield battle Manchester City we know without rodri Kevin De Bron we think a major doubt as well how do you see that panning out somewhere you got some big calls yourself obviously in that area of the pitch well I say yeah who regardless of whoever they play in there they're going to have an outstanding um team of midfielders however pep decides to play he's going to have a team full of players that have won continually um over the last few years so um I don't think it changes anything from our perspective I think we have to do our part and that is play our best and give everything we can physically to win the match thanks Nick Andy on Eddy uh I know you watch games back many many times how many times have you watched the fullen game back yeah I think it's one of those that we've gone back through it um various times to look at various different things um as I say sometimes you're looking for for things that you you can't find this was one I think was really obvious um for me where where we went wrong um which I'll you know obviously keep internal to to myself but we've done the work with the players on the on the training pitch their attitude to that work has been very good um and I think we're all focused on delivering a better performance like you've said it's not been the easiest in terms of performances recently when the going does get tough as a manager what's your kind of process to through that personally hard work don't think there's any any other way than training really well because I think if you train really well consistently the performances will come on the pitch and so I think there's been a real refocusing this week on how we train the standards that we deliver in our training um and I I have to say I think the players historically have have delivered that very very well here for a long period of time but of course nothing stay the same everything's always changing um and we have to stay on top of the small details and make sure that we're um managing ourselves correctly Nick talked about the Midfield that I know it's something that we've talked about in press conferences in the last few weeks in particular the balance of that Midfield what exactly is the balance you're looking for in the Newcastle Midfield it's a good question what is the balance well the balance is the that there's a good Harmony between all the players that we understand our roles um we understand the positions that we're playing and we execute that and what that position requires um I've got no issue with the balance of Midfield that that wasn't the issue against Fulham that there was sort of a a bigger problem um so I think whoever plays we're looking for them to deliver a Newcastle performance and just last one for me it's arguably the toughest test in World football right now taking on Manchester City so the big question what do your players have to do tomorrow to stop Manchester City well I think that there's a variety of things but I think just looking at ourselves I think we have to carry a threat I think we have to be um an attacking force in the game we have to be brave with the ball as well so forgetting their qualities which you you know is very easy to say you can't because they're an outstanding team but I think just looking at us we have to we have to as I say be that attacking force in the game and not forget what we're good at and I think that's absolutely crucial thank you Andy Nisha morning Edie and we talked about rogy being out and to BR likely out as well does it just give you that bit of extra belief that you can get a result you know they're missing arguably two their best players I think it's dangerous to focus on that because um you prepare the team that you think you're going to face and then you try and find a way to um compete with that team and then give them problems and deal with the problems they're going to give you it's the same for us you know we've been carrying long-term injuries now for a long period of time um and no one would regularly here is talking about Sven botman and Callum Wilson and Louie Miley etc etc jamala cells so and last year that wasn't really the case you have to deliver the team that you have with the team that you have and got no doubt Manchester City will peps done that throughout his management career he finds a way with the players that he has our challenge is whoever he picks is to be competitive and um try and impose ourselves on the game you said before that Tali is ready to start for you should you need him is he any closer to starting in the Premier League for you I mean we saw what he he's done in big games for Italy could he be that big game player for you well certainly he's got the um experience playing for a team like Milan and and Italy they high pressure games they're games where you're cons consistently Under Pressure to perform so I think he's got that in his in his game thought he did well again when he came on against Fulham so um yeah he's definitely knocking at the door and just finally for me this is a slightly challenging period for you at the moment is you still trying to get the best of your players this season how does it rate in terms of the other challenges you've had to face it's a different one because you've got a lot of points on the board probably not far off your your target for this stage but probably the performances haven't been up there I think you're always in a state of challenge you're always in a state where you're having to respond what whatever the situation is whether it's on the pitch off the pitch I think there's always questions asked when you're in this position um I'd probably take that way at the moment where we've got the points but we haven't performed because I know the qualiity there I know the individual abilities there I know the collective Spirits there um but it's you know it's time to show it and um you know we have to deliver thank you thanks n we've got to Damian and then hi Eddie um you've talked a lot about Collective performances not being quite to the height you would hope but some of your your bigger players have also struggled perhaps to to replicate their best form with with hindsight do you think they were affected by the speculation over the summer and the the difficulties you had at at that time well yeah just just touching on that I think your your Collective performance is always defined by the individuals within it so if your individual players aren't performing you're going to suffer especially if they're you know in the important areas of the pitch that make the difference so um we have a responsibility everyone has a responsibility to try and be at their best individually now you're never going to be there every single game you're going to have Peaks and troughs throughout the season every player does um but we need we need some people to step up within the team and that will have a g galvanizing effect on the group and that's what we need um and I've got no doubt on the players that um are in my mind that they can deliver that there's no other reason why they they can't as I said they've trained well this week there's been a real um focus on that so let's see what we deliver this weekend and just many people particularly op would regard Alan sheer as the greatest striker of the Premier League era you're coming up against erling Harland tomorrow could he be the man to to take that mantle well I don't think there's many that are going to get close to Alan because of his record over the the time that he did it was was truly incredible really the amount of goals that he scored when you see the the numbers um that's going to be some Target to beat but you're probably looking at someone like earling um Holland who's had an incredible start and just his appetite for goals is incredible really when you watch him play he uh you know I'm a big admirer of his I'm a big admire of his game but I think the most um um stand out attribute is his want to score his need to score he'll you know really strong quick um deadly finisher so he he's someone that we're going have to play very well against and I think we've had some good battles against him before um but I I don't think you'll ever managed to sort of keep him quiet throughout the game you just have to manage situations well they've got obvious threats from other areas of the pitch as well so a real Collective effort is going to be needed in terms of our defensive display to keep them out thanks Daman Lee Ryder more NY um on Sandro um he obviously played the 90 minutes for Italy over the international break is that something if You' have been able to control that would you have been happy with that given he's not played 90 minutes for Newcastle um in what respect like so he he doesn't play you mean if if he would have been able to play less minutes for Italy would you have been happier with that given you obviously trying to drop them in stage by stage yeah I think look Italy um played him for the two games and they played him for 90 minutes got no issue with that he long time without football um so no I'm not going to sit here and say well we weren't happy with his game management I think it was fine I was really pleased he came through it and I think when he came back we had to manage him to a degree because he was he was very tired and physically and mentally fatigued it was a big two games for him you got to understand from Sandro's perspective that was a big moment not just his return to us but his return to the national team was a big thing so he's under a lot of pressure but he's handled himself really well he's trained really well this week um he looks like his energy is is in a good place so I'm really pleased with him and obviously asked you this on Saturday as well but like there's just be this clamor continues for him to start games for Newcastle what does he have to do in order to get on that starting team sheet there's no magic trick it's train well and when you get a chance to play play well do that consistently and um I say the same to any player you'll end up in the team and just on the political situation if you want to call it that um that's continue this week I mean it's obviously something you don't want I would imagine as head coach but how helpful or unhelpful is it for you that you've got like caraga and Neville devoting like 45 minutes on a podcast to what's happening upstairs at newcast United well that's the first I've heard of it so um genuinely I I didn't know about that so I I don't know what to say thanks Le got to Chris W and then Jordan Chris more Eddie in terms of you mentioned Alexander isach still struggling with his toy injury is he a doubt for tomorrow then or is he fit and available to play yeah it'd be a doubt for tomorrow I think um he trained last week before the Fulham game on the Friday just trying to remember um and he had an injection in his toe to play he felt fine um but but then he he started to feel his toe I think in the last 5 to 10 minutes of that game um and then after the game it sort of stiffened up and wasn't in a great place early in the week so um he hasn't trained yet so we'll have to make a decision again as to whether he trains today um or he misses the game and if you don't have him are you confident that you have the options to be able to play through the midd and know Anthony Gordon can play there but you don't have another fit senior out out strike you've got willo made his deut last year but are he confident you've got the resources there yeah I think Anthony we've always viewed him as our sort of third striker in a sense because he's he'll play it differently very differently to Callum and Alex because he's not sort of your out andout line leader but he's he's very very clever at what he does when he plays in that role I think he did well against wolves in the second half he's more of a drifter in terms of his position so he won't necessarily be the focal point but he certainly got the pace to run in behind um and the ability to link plays so he'll play it slightly low but can still be very effective thanks Chris Jordan cron more I think I'm right saying that Anthony and cvey both prep play on the left hand side um and maybe feel they play their best football can Harvey and Anthony play in the same team when Alex is fit I think you'd be right in that assessment I think they both prefer the left-and side um and I think you can see in their performances they probably play their best football there managing that positional um need is a challenge that for me especially if they both deserve to play um that I'm confident we can find a solution to they have both played in the same team before but obviously it means a slightly positional tweak for one of them because you can't play what you can you can try and play two left Wingers in the same position but I'm not sure that would work um maybe that's a new thing we should think about um but yeah I'm confident we can find a solution and there was a lot of fans commented on Anthony Gordon's body language last week at Fulham have you noticed a difference in him since he returned for preseason I think um regarding that anony is still the same lad he's still very very focused on his career very focused on his performance he wants to do well he wants to do well for Newcastle I think him he like a number of the other players a little bit frustrated and sometimes that frustration in a performance in a game can manifest itself in various ways so we need to you to be mindful of that and control that ourselves um it wouldn't just be Anthony I was frustrated um I'm sure everyone else connected with Newcastle was frustrated so we just need to be mindful of how that looks thanks John we got to Craig then uh Chris sorry Luke and then Scott on NY I think a big strength of you and your team over the last three years has been that we could almost pick the stting 11 ourselves you had a settled team there was that muscle memory there you saw the little patterns and Partnerships all over the page would you agree that hasn't been there this season and how close are you to knowing your best 11 and finding that sort of continuity and that settled element of the team yeah I'd agree with your point um I've got no issue with that I think we're we're slightly um a bit transitional with that in a sense of finding the balance I think the issue for me is I think I would know given a um a blank sheet of paper and say right go and write down what you think your best team is I don't think that'll be difficult for me but the problem is you've got to justify your selection so those players have to be in their best moment in their best form and what you can't do is pick that team if it doesn't deserve to play I hope you sort of follow me so um I'm a big believer in rewarding people that are playing well I'm a big believer in there's no set team everyone has to earn their place and if you're not earning your place you can't play so I think we're in that moment where we're early season players haven't been in their best form difficult to pick people if they're not playing continually well and we're at that stage now where I'm going to have to make some difficult decisions I think I think that talks as well to an earlier answer you gave where you said it wasn't about the balance of the Midfield there was a a bigger problem and players have to play like Newcastle players does that talk to the basics of effort and Endeavor and application it talks through all the the dimensions of the game our organization our structure um so of course I think you need whatever team you pick whether people think it's the best team or or not on paper that team has to commit to what it's being asked to do and then deliver a performance in the lines of what we've been used to watching here and I think that's the challenge for us is to forget everything else and just get back to our very best levels in terms of our energy and our running and if we can do that the ability will will come back thanks Greg Luke um there's been some news this week that Anthony Gordon's quite close to agreeing a new contract how good is there any update you can give on that and how much of a good news would that be for you and for Newcastle and for him yeah I always find that those questions quite difficult because I'm you you good you're asking me to comment on something that hasn't happened um with the potential of looking silly if it doesn't so I'm just trying to think of the best way to answer it we uh we love Anthony we'd love him to commit his future here um we'd love him to to stay longterm at Newcastle and continue his excellent start to his career here because when you look at the broader um piece of what he's done since he's arrived at the football club I think he's been magnificent for us we need to try and help him get back to his very best levels um and if that means signing a new contract then I'm all for that to help him be settled and concentrate on his football um how refreshing is it to have a press conference and not be on asked about your relationship with with Paul Mitchell well you've just ruined that luk thank you but everything's good thanks for asking um just finally the when the Takeover happened we're coming up to the third year anniversary of it you're playing the club this weekend Manchester City while The Benchmark who everybody assumed Newcastle were going to turn into how do you assess where Newcastle are in terms of closing that Gap with Manchester City very difficult to again give you a clear answer because I've got no idea where Manchester City are I mean I see the results on the pitch but in terms of off the pitch I've got no idea of what of what they've done and what they do how how much they've grown the club and I have a perception but I don't know the reality I can only talk about Newcastle and what we're doing and I think that we've got unbelievable owners that want to do some amazing things here um but these things do take time and I think there needs to be patience from from everybody connected with the club in terms of how quickly we can move things forward and the speed of that will always be I know people always want things sort of in the here and now but the likes of the know the training new training grounds new stadium plans uh Redevelopment of St James's part what whatever it is takes time and of course then looking at the team with PSR restrictions that will take time as well so I think as long as from my viewpoint that we're still trying to move things forward develop the team in in the in the correct way there's still a big ambition um then people can see progress then I think that's a a really positive thing but it's it's not easy at the level we're competing against thank you thanks Luke Scott Wilson Eddie um you'll obviously have all the the data and the metrics and everything at your disposable but from the outside looking in it feels a little bit like maybe some of the intensity hasn't been there when you play this season that the high press that was such a a big part of what you are the the aggression the energy do the metrics that out and and if so is that a shift in tactics you're trying to make or is it something that ideally you would like to get back to to the levels you were at there's definitely been no shift in what we want um no far from it we want to step step it up and improve it um so there's no part of us that's trying to retreat and become more proactive sorry reactive rather than proactive so no um but then you look at our ability to do that hasn't been of the levels it's been in previous years and there's been a whole multitude of reasons for that it's not as maybe as simple as people think um and of course I've been trying to manage that behind the scenes with the squad but longer term I've got no doubts we will get back to that style um yeah very quickly is of course the ideal and and just one more on Alexander has he had scans or anything and is there any any fear that this might need a an operation at some stage no he's had scans he's had lots of tests the the injury has been diagnosed fine um there's no issues there he's got um it sounds worse than it is but he's got a a broken toe but it's one that can be managed and played with um providing he can tolerate the pain levels and that will have no longterm uh uh risks yeah so he had an injection to to sort of numb the toe last week and that was fine as I say until the injection wore off um so let's see how he is today thank you thanks Scott we'll go to Dominic and then Mark morning Eddie you said after Fulham you'd have to think of ways to try and make Alexander isack more impactful in games do you have a solution to that or is the lack of training for him prevented finding that solution well yeah difficult of course we've done video analysis with him this week and had several convers ations but yeah it's clear to me that we uh we need to tweak a few things in his game um well I say in his game and just in how we're using him and and what we're doing with him so um but of course we haven't had the opportunity to do that on the training pure and you mentioned last season your identity was a big part down to the Personnel Joe Linton being a key part of that now since he's returned why do you think that identity is maybe still lacking to what it was previously that's not just one player it's not just one player when you when you're trying to um deliver an an identity or a Clear Vision of how you want your team to play it's 11 players and if one player in that 11 doesn't follow the plan or doesn't deliver what you ask him to do the whole thing falls apart especially at this level because teams are good enough to expose that one weak area so um yes jolson's return is a huge thing for us to help us and I think um you know he'll be a key driver of that but it's not just down to him next Mark Eddie you mentioned uh training there can you just tell us you said it it's s of almost gone up a level this week is that is that like from where it was before or is it just that you've kind of demanded greater greater focus and intensity from players I'm not sure I said when upper level but if I did then um okay uh I just think there was a a slightly different Focus from us so a slightly different angle um which of course you'll always have depending on your opponent um depending on what games you have coming up I think you can shift themes there was a particular theme of our work and it was good to see it um also Bruno's been sort of talked about as one of the players who maybe not quite hit his levels so far is that something you're concerned about or do you think it will come with him and it is still maybe a physical thing yeah I I think again for someone like Bruno had a very compacted summer he had a lot going on he comes back really short training time he's straight into the games and then probably a time when we'd want to do some real real work with him he goes back away again long flights it is difficult for the International Players especially ones that have to travel such big distances because you lose we lose time with them and then they come back to us and they're too fatigued to work again so um Bruno is someone that again is very keen to do well he knows that he has to try and give more to the team I think there's a real desire from him to help um the team and get back to his very very best levels um and back his quality there's no denying the character the player um but he's such a vital part of our team right in the heartbeat of the team he cond duct so much for us that um you know we need him back to his best levels thanks Mark got to Martin Louise and then Kieran hi Eddie um just interested in your thoughts on Arsenal's game against Manchester City last week and probably specifically the second half performance from uh Arsenal it was a great game to watch I really enjoyed it um you know you're looking at two teams you got one with 11 one with 10 and it fascinating because they're such a difficult team to play against anyway with with 11 players yet alone with 10 so I thought Arsenal did really really well um to nearly see the game out I mean it would have been um a a really fascinating second half to watch for lots of different reasons of course tactically I'm watching games tactically for that for that viewpoint but there was a lot to take from it and I thought Manchester city did what they do they they always find a way or usually find a way to score big goals in big moments and um their spirit is unquestionable so really good to see the two teams go against each other uh and a lot of European games this week are you missing European football and is it a realistic goal to get back there next season to be honest it's not been my thoughts at all this week it's been head down a lot of work a lot of focus on us us after Fulham Us in preparation for Manchester City I haven't really raised my head at European football to be honest Thanks Martin Louise hi Eddie um are you tempted at all to to tweak the formation or even rip it apart um and is your is your lack of fit available Center halves um preventing say experimenting with three at the back we have played with three at the back of the season um and we are tweaking our system continually game to game uh might not be evident on the eye and I understand that that's not a condescending comment that's because the things we do are quite subtle they're not easy to always read but our system isn't the same game to game um so no definitely not rip it up but definitely tweak from game to game you have to for me I mean if we play the same way F them away to Manchester City at home I think that's a weakness um so we're continually looking for Solutions and to give opponents problems I I mean I'm about sort of mental more fundamental shift but do you think formations are almost kind of um Irrelevant in modern football because there's so much kind of kaleidoscopic you know positional interchanging and and as you say in-game ingame tweaks yeah 100% I think everyone's obsession with maybe a starting system is actually irrelevant because when you look at teams in possession Now teams are playing us included three four five systems then without the ball a lot of teams are man for man so the system becomes irrelevant so it's it's a Fascination really that's probably going to weigh in the future um and it then becomes more about your identity and your style and what you're trying to do rather than sort of the players and how they're lined up thanks Lise Kier um morning it's very different landscape compared to the third year the Manchester City project um do you feel it's it's possible for Newcastle to get to the top with the current rules in the coming years depends how long you're talking I suppose I mean yes I think long longterm providing that our income sources increase dramatically um but that's looking sort of a long way ahead shortterm probably not I think it's very very difficult but I think my job is to get the best out of what I have and I've never had a problem trying to execute that so you might not have the the biggest or be able to you know spend but you can still be highly effective and try and be successful um given what you have and that'll change that will never change for me no matter if we were able to spend you know the maximum amount it's getting the best at what you have is key yeah um we've seen your team previously get criticized for game management but our approved at the weekend everyone does it do you want to see a nasty side from your team tomorrow yeah I think we have during this season I don't think that nasty side has gone it certainly wasn't evident against Fulham but I think there's been other games where we have managed the game really well and of course every team does it I mean any team that says we don't isn't telling the truth every team will have ways um strategic points that they'll try to to help their team get the result because ultimately the result is what we're all chasing"
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,W-5GwuDGcC8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-5GwuDGcC8,good morning Eddie how is Alexander isach good question um find out more today I think he's it was a strange run with his eye so the ball just grazed his eye um and we felt at that time that was the main reason for him um coming off the pitch then he had a a knock to his foot as well so he's got sort of a combination of the two um we make a decision today did he pick up the knock out wolves as well yeah yeah both of them towards the end of the half your options then without Alexander ISAC um may be a bit limited can you tell us what the situation is with Callum Wilson this week too yeah Callum won't make the game um I think we're looking with Callum to be um the next International break we hope to have him back in full training uh ready for the games following uh so of course that leaves Anthony who did a really good job for us against wolves and willisa who's done really well since he's been with us I know he hasn't um played any minutes yet but we've been delighted with his progress um he's got all the tools so um yeah we feel we've got good cover as you mentioned Willie moula hasn't played for you yet he's been an unused substitute so far but he was pretty impressive in the friendly at St James's that he played um this could potentially be a big few days for him couldn't it with the Cup tie at wimon following Fulham yeah absolutely and he's someone that we really we really do like um there's always a process I think it's a big move for him um he's adapted well to that I have to say he's very mature comes in with a big smile on his face every day committed to his work we've begun the process of developing his game and just smoothing out some um areas that we feel need development and of course just getting him to understand what we do and how we play but I got really high hopes for him and another forward player we've not seen a lot of is Miguel alaron and I suppose when you think of Fulham against Newcastle you'll always remember that wonderful goal he scored two seasons ago is he in a condition to start for you again if you need him to alaron yeah absolutely I think migy has trained well this week he came back uh in a really good place from his International um games where he did really well and got some good minutes under his belt so I think he like the other players that played in the summer tournaments had limited training time but we're delighted with always with his attitude and how he committed he is um but I feel he's in a much better place now what do you make of what you've seen from fham so far this season yeah I think always a very good team and a lot of time for Marco and his style of play I think he's produced a team that are full of energy Pace in the in the right areas really good football team always try to play the game in the right way very efficient attacking team I think they've added a couple of really good players this summer both in attack and defense so it's always a difficult game then they've been tight Affairs um so yeah no games easy in the Premier League I know we say that and it's a well- used expression but when you look at oura games this year Bournemouth and wolves have both been very difficult for us and we expect this to to be the same but knowing from our perspective that um we'll do everything we can to win finally you'll be aware of the table and the current standings you go top if you win on Saturday yeah I mean I only found that out this morning actually um sort of head down into the work as always and not really aware of the other fixtures this weekend I think I'd be nice for us um it's a great motivation for us this weekend of course it means nothing cuz it's so early but that's where we want to be thanks Razer Andy P morning Eddie uh obviously last season we saw quite a few freak injuries were you rather hoping that you'd left the freak injuries the strange injuries in last season after Alex eak last week yeah I always think you're going to get the odd the odd thing during the season of course you will um I thought last season was incredible with the amount of strange ones we had and ones that were difficult to work out why where that's two shoulder injuries really from innocuous situations or Dan landing on his back and etc etc but I think they's see with Alex let see hopefully it's not too bad uh not sure if you see but only Manchester City Arsenal Liverpool have got more points than Newcastle United since you actually took over the job nearly three years ago I know you're not won for stats I know you're not won things like that but that's a pretty proud record no I am one for stats if they favor us no I no I am I'm very statistically uh driven in in terms of trying to identify things that you think can help the team but I don't think they are the be all and end all but I think when you that's nice to hear I don't sit and waste time on things like that because that doesn't really directly affect the next result or your team's performance but I think it's nice to know that especially for the players that we are a good team and we've been consistently a good team that the uh the danger with that is it doesn't predict the future you know the future is ours to make so as much as we have done well for that period of time and we have to continue to do well just on Harvey Barnes you described him as the best finishing Winger that you've seen I mean you're not normally that effusive with hyperbole with things like that what makes him the best finishing Winger that you've seen apart from obviously the the way he takes his goals yeah I just think he's got a real coolness in front of goal I mean it's it's and of course it's related to his technical ability he's got this way that he strikes the ball um as I say he's got the composure but also his positioning is very good you don't score the amount of goals that he has without getting into the right areas so he's got that gift for being in the right place at the right time I mean I think you look at his goal on Sunday that wasn't about necessarily his positioning that was about his ball striking ability um now he's got really unique talents um we really like him and he's a really humble lad as well he wants to do well he's prepared to work for the team he's prepared to do all the all the off the ball stuff that we need so um I'm delighted with how he started the season we spoke to him yesterday and like any player he naturally wants to start how close do you think he is too regularly starting in this Newcastle United 11 well I think regularly starting is going to be down to him um that's going to be down to him in his performances there's going to be no guarantees given on that and that's the same for any player you earn your place by how you perform week in week out um he's certainly done his his uh chances of starting from the bench no harm because that's what you can only affect is when you're not starting the game is when you come onto the pitch you give so much and you you make an immediate impact that um you try and force the manager's hand in the next team selection is celebration certainly become iconic I noticed on Sunday obviously Bruno had to have a quick word with him does Bruno celebrate goals on the training pitch like he does on a match day because it's becoming quite a a feat amongst fans now I don't know really I don't really look at individual players celebrations you might know more than me but I I actually really like the celebration aspect because I think that can tell you a lot about where your team's at so individually I always encourage players that score to celebrate embrace the moment um embrace your own supporters if you can I really encourage the team to celebrate together as well because I think it's such a that's what you're working for you're working for those moments where you can unite together and celebrate each other's successes so I think that does tell you a lot about the inner Dynamics and the workings of the team of course then you've got to get your refocus back very quickly because the game's going to restart so then there's there's actually benefits for you coming together to celebrate together to actually refocus on the next moment in the game just finally uh we talk to Alex EAC what about the other team news looking into this weekend Joe Willock obviously featured against wolves leis Miley as well what's the other team news from a Newcastle perspective yeah Louis Miley is still a long way off he's not um he's back on the grass but he's not back with us so he's a long way um yeah still got the long-term injuries I don't think we've got anything fresh apart from Alex thanks Edie Nisha BBC morning Eddie uh the other two subs that you brought on willik and talii um are they pushing as well to start and is Tali ready to start if you need him this certainly pushing to start and I I want everyone pushing to start and that's the beauty of our recent performances is the players coming on the pitch in whatever situation we've been in have impressed and certainly the last two three team selections have been difficult for that reason um Sandro yeah I think Sandro's in a much better place than he was the two International games would have definitely helped him um and I think you saw that in his performance against wolves he was very good um so yeah got really good competition for places in Midfield at the moment of got that strange thing of a wonderful start but without really hitting fifth gear how are how are you managing that because there's got to be a lot of satisfaction from the results but I guess you still want more from that team yeah I mean I think there's a few things to say on that I think no game's easy so I know there's um for myself there's obviously critiquing the team and going we can do better but when you go to wolves and away from home um and we had total control of the game for 20 minutes we lost that control um then the second half was a bit um transitional we managed to find a way to it that's something we didn't do last year away from home so I'm more than happy to take though those types of wins because you're never going to dominate your opponent well of course that's your wish but it's difficult to dominate your opponent for the whole game especially away so sometimes you have to accept your um the game's not going to be totally controlled but you need to do well in the big moments and that's what we've done I think overall yes I've been hard on the players and the respect that I want I want more but still acknowledging that there's a lot of good qualities in our performances as well and just finally for me is there much work going on at the moment in terms of new deals for players um I'm slightly detached from that so I I can't give you any details I think it's always something that's on the club's mind in the respect of making sure we protect the long-term interest of the club with players contracts and we don't get in difficult situations so uh that works always ongoing thanks Nisha thanks broadcasters of course writtens Damian hi Eddie um on on at the weekend when you brought Kieran trippier on at a difficult moment in the game he he seemed to steady the ship a bit and calm everyone down is that one of the reasons you were so Keen to keep him here that that kind of influence on the team yeah I do think he has a strong well he has really strong qualities in his game um and composure decision making on the ball is definitely one or a couple of those qualities also his his longer ball passing his his range his creativity around the box he brings a lot with the ball we you know we've been really good um down his side of the pitch since he's been at the football club in no small part down to the relationships he's had with the players around him but his his quality of his work so yeah that's what you hope for when you bring him onto the pitch that he can demonstrate that um I thought he did really well on Sunday um and I think he's in a I think he's in a good place just alluding to what Nisha was asking about there how close do you think your team is to clicking well hopefully very close but I yeah I I I think if you look back the last couple of years I think there's a there's a lot of games where you're not you know in the fifth gear whatever bracket you want to put it in but you can still win games in third and fourth and that's what we didn't do well enough last year I think it's very rare you get into those moments where everything's going your way and that's S course what we're looking for and I think there has to be an improvement in sort of key aspects of our game which we're working towards thanks Dam we'll go to Dominic then Lee and then Ian morning Eddie you touched on it before regarding player contracts but a lot of talked this week about sha long staff's contract situation potential of a new deal given the PSR situation surrounding the club how important is it you secure players like him and other players who could potentially leave for nothing secure their future yeah I think you're talk talking more broadly going back to joling situation when his contract was getting to a a delicate time losing players to free transfers is um is not something that we want to be fighting really a football club for many different reasons and probably the biggest is it's a distraction for the players I don't think in my experience players tend to play well when they start running their contract down into that last year it's a very uncertain time for them so I think we want the players at their best we want to protect the asset value of the individual player as well and to replace any player that's in and around our Squad is going to cost us a lot of money so we've got to be very careful with those decisions yeah and um rodri from Manchester City who you play next week spoke about the possibility of players going on strike due to the nature of the hectic fixture schedule just wondering what your thought on that given how how much you suffered from a hectic fixture schedule last season yeah I think it's different for us I think not being in Europe I think it changes the dynamic this season um but certainly for the players that are in the Champions League and full Internationals their schedule is this intense very very intense now they get well rewarded for that but it's it's a real takes a real toll on their bodies first and foremost and of course then you got the mental aspect so um I think it's a difficult one for for me to sort of be forceful on because we're in a different situation this year where we're we're not going to have the intensity of games we had last year we're week to week in the Premier League of course we hope to have really good cut runs the international players have a different Dynamic again um we always need to think about the welfare of the players it is so important they're the guys that produce the product um so there's a lot to but of course there's a lot that goes into it with TV revenue and various competition so it's for someone else to De side thanks Tom got a lead Rider hi Eddie just on the the week to we buildup uh of games now you haven't got Europe you've obviously been able to maybe take a breather and watch some of the European games how's it been working on the training pitch having more time to enjoy with the players yeah I mean I don't think we've sort of seen the full benefit of that I mean of course this week yes there was European competition um but we had a six Six Day lead leading to uh to this game because of the Wolves game so that felt actually quite intense um then we've got the cup game next week so it feels like um it's a busy spell for us but I think we will benefit our Premier League form will hopefully benefit from not having the the intensity of games that we had last year especially around December that was the the real time when we sort of failed to deal with that with the injuries that we had I think before that we were we were really enjoying it and I thought we were relatively uh stable in in the respect that we're able to rotate the team and put good teams out onto the pitch it was only December that really hurt us and obviously what happened last season finishing seventh has that made you hungrier has it made the the squad hungrier to succeed this season I see a really U motivated team motivated Squad of players that want to do something special this year I I have no issues with the the mindset of the group The a commitment to our training has been very good so far players have been in different places I said that many times with the summer and we're still I think we were in a much better place than we were in terms of the overall um levels Fitness levels of the group um so yeah it's early days but um we're very motivated to do well this season and just finally obviously you can't go top of the table for a brief time um are you in a position where you feel you can challenge for that top spot this season season or is it too early and should be looking at top probably challenging for top five setting me up here I think um no I'm not I think I think as I said earlier I think it's very early um there's can always be overreaction to both ways at this stage of the season if you start poorly I think there's an overreaction and if you start well there can possibly be an overreaction I think for us it's about just staying very calm and just trying to win every game that we we play and the next game is always the focus film's away is a difficult game um it's a really nice Stadium to play and we look forward to going there but it's a tough game and then of course we have the cup game so we're just taking it step by step we're not making any long-term predictions um or statements but it's about trying to get to our best levels thanks go to Ian Chris and then Scott morning Eddie morning uh when the sides are losing games a lot of MERS claim that they'd be more worried if performances weren't good the winning managers worry when performances quite what they're looking for yes I I think there's been a certain element of that in my in my head where um I want the players to be aware that there's more to come but as I said earlier in answer to a question that there's been a lot of our performances that have been good it's just we haven't been consistent within the game so I want to make this clear I'm not saying that we've played consistently poorly we haven't um we've just been inconsistent within the games and it's a case of trying to find that consistency within the match so we don't give our opponents um any momentum in a game and potentially we have control of it so but there's two teams to every game and the level is so high so um we're talking small percentages that we can improve but that will hopefully make the difference for us but just um looking at Team selection obviously every player has got their own strengths and their own weaknesses if you got if you take sha longa out of a side what does the team lose well I just got to look at Sha's qualities um Sha's qualities are highly intelligent um understands the teams um objectives whether that's in and out of possession um technically very good player he's got a goal in him and high energy you look at his like running data week to week it's usually one of the highest in the Premier League so he brings a lot of energy to the team so there his strengths that's what we would miss if he's not playing because it was about this time last year when a lot of people came around to the fact that you know might Newcastle at that time looked a better side with Shan long stuff in it yeah I mean look I think it's always difficult to talk about one player in such detail but Sha's been very very good since I've been here as manager he's been I think brilliant to work with from my perspective I think his General performances have improved he's still got areas to to to work on like every player has but he's been fundamentally important to the stats that Andy gave earlier you the team's performed really well and he's played near enough when he's been fit every game so um the competition now in Midfield is higher than it's ever been so he's going to know and be very aware of that that he's competing against very good players for his starting place that is a a battle that I hope elevates every single one of those players to play even better than they think they're capable of thanks Chris more Eddie you mentioned earlier that the two Internationals will have served Sandro talii well in terms of Fitness wise but is there also the need to sort of protect him a little bit in terms of the load that he might have in such a short period of time having not played so much is that coming into selection decisions as well yeah we'll always take an overview of everything and it's it's never as simple as maybe people saying it's maybe not as complicated as we try and make it but I think whenever there's a big spike in load so whether there's a big jump in in any type of physical area um with the players we have to be a little bit mindful of that and protect them but Sandro's very keen to play with very keen to see him play um but as I said just a second ago the competition for places is in Midfield is probably as strong as I've ever had here and you've got Internationals all fighting for for starting spots so Sandy will play he get his opportunities like he did against wolves on Sunday and he's got to grab them with both hands and just on another midfielder Joel willik was obviously missed a lot of last season as well and he's had his injury this year he seems to bring unique qualities to the side is that fair and and how much has he been missed in terms of what he does bring that is fair um I think you could see that on Sunday I think it was really evident his running ability his ball carrying ability his creativity around the Box slightly unpredictable Joe you never quite know what he's going to do but that's a strength not a weakness um that unpredictability is really good from an attacking perspective he's very popular with the players um I think they see his qualities they know what he can bring so foot and fully flying Joe willick is a real asset for us thanks Chris going to Scott Jordan and then Mark just off the back of that really Eddie um I mean last season it was very rare if well obviously it wasn't really because of Sandro's situation that you had Joel Linton Sandro Willock longstaff Bruno all fit I mean you've kind of touched on it but but but is this now the toughest Midfield selection kind of conundrum you've had in your time here just because kind of whoever you you leave out is going to have very valid reasons to be playing yeah I think so um but these are the decisions that when we signed those players that we wanted um and we felt we needed for especially for a season in the Champions League and then when you add Louis Miley to that group you've got you've got six outstanding Center Midfield players but a a club like ourselves with the Ambitions that we have we need we need that strength and depth and we prob possibly don't have that in other positions in the in the squad um so my wish is that they all stay fit they all push each other and I have some really tough decisions to make and and just secondly if if if it if if it is to be Anthony up front or if at some stage is to be Anthony playing through the middle I mean we've all seen he can do that we've seen him do it for you that's we've seen him do it for England under 21s obviously in the tournament um but he is clearly a very different player in that area than either Alexander or Callum would be now I know you'll say you tailor the way you attack to lots of different things but does there have to be fairly major changes to the way you attack as a team and look to construct attacks if it is Anthony through the middle really um no we work to us um a detailed plan and that plan can be adapted to any individual um obviously we'd need to work with um with the player in those those movements but I think Anthony's a really intelligent player he can he's multi multi- talented he can play Anywhere across the front three possibly even play as midfielder so I think he's got the skills that adapt to that position and as you say he's got the experience of playing for us there England there and scoring goals and doing very well so uh I would have no doubts thanks Scott Jordan hi Eddie you mentioned about colum Wilson not been available until next at National break why is it taking so long for for colum to recover has it been a complex injury perhaps a more complex injury might you initially thought I think any injury to the the hamstring is potentially complex there's been no reinjury it's just the case of readjusting the time scales really depending on how he felt um so we've we've had to listen to to his body when he's had delivered the work and we've just felt he's been rescanned obviously um that it's maybe not as healed as quickly as we'd hoped so um a slight adjustment and uh yeah but hopefully we'll have him back fully fit and firing for the next group of games which will be really important we have missed him I think we've really missed his energy and what he brings to the squad the players um and have missed the competition that he brings you mentioned the back injury there is sorry the hamstring injury is is that a fresh injury as he recovered from the back injury yeah so yeah the back injury um is there but it was sort of connected so um yeah he's working his way back and he's looking good at the moment and how and how is he CU i' imagine it's not a an easy time for him being unavailable yeah he's been fine I think there's always an initial disappointment because it was just I think very early into preseason when he picked up the injury and he was really in you know looking forward to the season he was in a great place um and I think you know when you know you're going to miss the early part of the Season there's that I'm not going to I'm not going to play early on is it going to be you know how's the season going to unfold for me from that point there's a lot of doubts that go into the players's head but then after you get over that initial disappointment you just see the return date and you just fight then to get back as quickly as possible and Callum is doing that but I think sensibly um the medical team are managing him and making sure he comes back at the right time thanks Jordan Mark Douglas uh Eddie the two away games you played this season for you picked up four points last season you only picked up one point from those two games how satisfying is that and what have you sort of changed about your performances and and set up away from home or is it just a question of having players available um I think as I've said many times we set up slightly differently for every opponent I don't think you can every opponent is very different so you can't go in with one plan that's what we do and that's what we do again and again and again because you're not adjusting them for the opponent's strength but also you're not exploiting their potential weaknesses so every game plan is bespoke to our next opponent so you can't really draw parallels to last year of course the more players you have to select from the deeper the poll the more options you have to play certain players against direct opponent that might be a better fit for us um but I just think in the two away games we've dug in really well in difficult moments in the game we've hung in there and then we've taken our chances when they've come and just finally following on from last week has there been any contact between you and Paul this week or is it something that you've just kind of forgotten about really this week I'm not going to you know uh go into every week in terms of our our contact but collaboration as I've said last week is what we're looking to do to take the club forward thanks Mark conr to Craig and then Louise so have you spoken to Paul this week I think I just answered that one Craig I'm not going to go there you're not going to go there no uh would it be good beneficial if you and others him whoever at the club did sit down and have a conversation and address some of the some of the sort of concerns that's been yeah I just so people know I've had conversations with senior members of the board this week so I'm in regular communication with them um and as I said trying to collaborate trying to work together for the benefit of the club all always uh that's always in my heart and that will always be while I'm manager of the club and you said something after the game last week you know that your focus has got to be on unifying sort of yourself your staff the players and supporters is that is that still the message is that your concentration that's where you can make your gains it has to be it has to be and I'm always the first one to say the players are the most important people for me my direct work is always about the players and trying to get them in the best frame of mind to to win football matches the tighter the group The More We Come Together the better for everybody and I include the supporters in that as well because I think they can directly affect the players as well on the pitch so creating the best environment um the whole club United on that front is basically all we need to get results now the other stuff is hugely important um boardroom level and behind the scenes but that's more for the the transfer windows and the you know all those kind of things but at the moment we can't affect that so let come together and I think the players really have I think we've got a really good team spirit a really good tight group um and now it's about getting us um consistently to play well thank you thanks Craig Louise hi Eddie um there seems to be a sort of school of of of thought that sometimes particularly after a big tournament summer if if players are undercooked a little bit if that's the word in preseason training um it can be to the benefit later in the season and that performances can gradually improve I mean given that it was a big tournament summer and that you've had James bunts come in who presumably has tweaked a few things here and there is that the situation with you or is that totally rubbish no one says totally rubbish I think you got some really valid points there I think I think with tournament football it does affect the players I mean how can it not so they've had emotionally a big a lot of the players that have played in those tour especially the ones that have gone late into the tournaments have had a bit big emotional um time they they've had a big physical load and then a big come down and a short break and then they've been asked to go again and I think naturally that is easier maybe for some players than others I think we just have to look at our our group I can't look at the others in the Premier League and I think there may be a bounce hopefully later on in the season it may take a little bit longer for them to get to their best levels I think we're better than than we were a few weeks ago I think at the start of the Season we were um I don't know whether under Cooks the right word but there were some players that were undercooked and weren't in their best physical condition but we felt the best way to get them there was to try and play them try and get them fit through games and I think you've seen that probably show in some of our performances thanks loise finish with Mar and then Gary hi Eddie just to go back to that how unified is the club is a hall right now yeah I think the club is is Unified yeah I don't see I don't see any issues um depends where you're talking about that unification but the unification between me the players the supporters and the board I think is really strong obviously going back to Germany how content do you feel in your position at the minute yeah I'm really happy as I've said many many times I'm enjoying the work with the players I love the group that we have I really do enjoy coming into work to plan training and to execute training with them I think we're on a journey together I hope that Journey can stay and as you as has been mentioned you can go top this weekend how far do you feel you're away from those top two teams Manchester City and Arsenal right now I I don't see how we can compare ourselves to them currently but the aim is to is to get there the aim is to close the gap every day every week that's what we're working towards um that has to be our aim longer term aim and shortterm aim and that's what I'm trying to work towards Thanks Martin car to finish morning Eddie um just going back briefly there um to the Future transfer window how important is it to tie down uh Alexander and Anthony get the contract sorted to stop another window of speculation for the fans yeah I mean I think having your um players secure in their Futures is is key to their performances I said that earlier on you you don't want the you know the the transfer speculation the contracts potentially running into shorter terms because I just think it distracts and rarely it benefits the player or the club so my wish is that the players are always focused on their on their performances the outside distraction is minimal and our best way to do that is to get the secure and and happy but of course there's a balance because you know wage structures PSR we can't be Reckless with what we do either so um we have to get those calls right but of course getting those players to play at their best levels will have a dramatic effect on our season would you say that's probably the club's top priority before January trying to get one or both Sid well I think if there there's issues with either player or any player then of course um communication resolving any issues that's um that's really important
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,zbgdvIRPb3I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbgdvIRPb3I,morning everyone uh just a quick reminder on your microphones please turn them on and off after each question otherwise the audio picks up every noise in the room U we'll start Matthew morning Eddie uh have all the players that were away on International Duty come back and and are they all okay and fit yeah we hope so I think there's a few more checks to make today but I think uh everyone as far as we know has come back and is in decent shape quite a few of your players had a lot of football for their countries and the rest of the squad were here training with you and I think after the Spurs match before the break you said that some weren't at Optimum level of Fitness do you feel you've made good progress in that regard over the last two weeks yeah I feel we have I think it's been productive for us we gave them a period of rest and then we started our our work towards wolves um yeah some good training I've been really pleased we we had very low num numbers initially I think we had say seven players that was boosted to around nine Midway through and then uh yeah gradually through the week we've built our numbers up with the players returning can you tell us how the new head of performance James buns is working with you in that regard when it comes to Fitness levels training and and the load that the the players have yeah James is working really well I have to say I think he's been hugely impressive since he's come in he's very passionate hardworking um involved from the very start of the planning phase of training to the execution um gives us really detailed anal Anis afterwards as well so I think he's been a great addition to the team um yeah I've been very positive three matches in and it's the club's best start to a Premier League season for 13 years overall when you look back on the first block of games what would be your assessment yeah very good results um really pleased with the start we've made in in what as we know is such a difficult League uh yeah performance- wise we know we still haven't hit Top Gear I think we've done well in different passages of each game but not um consistently through the 90 minutes that's what we're looking to do and we're going to have to do because now we go into a spell where we're playing away from home um some difficult games um so we're preparing for that test and while you haven't lost yet wolves your opponents on Sunday haven't won but they have had a couple of difficult fixtures haven't they Arsenal and Chelsea in there and then a draw with Forest what do you make of the way that they've changed this season because they also lost a couple of big players in the summer yeah I think you're absolutely right I think you can look at the early fixtures or sorry results and draw conclusions that aren't accurate I think very tough start for them I think they they played well in their last game against notan Forest that was a very even game could have gone e either way and even the games against uh Chelsea was one of those freak results um because the game was tighter than the score line suggests and Arsenal they're right in the game as well so um always tough opponents wolves um yeah a lot of respect for Gary and the job that he's done there having no no knowing him personally um yeah I think he's done a great job thanks R Nick is SK Sports Yeah Eddie you you you just touched on Gary O'Neal there you were Portsmouth teammates weren't you and there's um obviously a cross reference with different spells in charge of Bournemouth um what do you make of the job he's doing so far at Wolves yeah very good I mean I think teammates is a loose ter because I was always injured and and he was always playing so I was watching him play um and I admired him as a player I thought he was very very uh good um technical player a lot of respect for him and it's been great to see his coaching Journey because um slightly different to mine he's been thrus in to a very high level of coaching and he's taken to it superbly well um he's a real thinker of the game and I I sort of knew that as a teammate very deep guy cares about the game you know really tactically astute so uh we'd be ready for a difficult challenge Lewis Hall man of the match display for England under 21s at the start of the week where where do you think he's in terms of his professional development Eddie and obviously does he come into your thoughts on on Sunday yeah he comes into my thoughts of course um not really pleased with his development since he's been with us I think he's uh growing and uh building in confidence all the time and I think you can see that from his uh early displays this season he's playing with an assuredness and a confidence um that goes with his technical ability and his um robustness is improving as well so no very happy that he's going to win um had his first starts for England under 21s and performed really well and Sandro tanali as well Eddie obviously 180 minutes for for Italy but he's only just back from his ban um Fitness wise is there any concern there about you know maybe a bit of early burnout how how are you managing that situation burnout after after not playing for so long yeah I mean it's it's a I was pleased to see him play first firstly I think those games would have done him the world of good um and he's performed well and and part of a winning team as well so great for Sandra I'm sure he's you know in a really good place um put his early steps for him it's the the first few weeks back with the lighted that he's available just touching back rewinding briefly given what happened on uh transfer deadline day as well Eddie the disappointment of not being able to get those Marquee signings in has there been a further conversation with you know fellow staff about what what's needed now going forward um in terms of you know that that togetherness and unity planning for what needs to happen in further windows and you all on the same him sheet yeah no no discussions yet towards January um no further discussions on anything it is about unity and it is about coming together now and making sure we focus on this time at the moment for me is all about the games and trying to get results Andy well Eddy um good to see you when you were on your way to the press conference this morning were you a little bit relieved and pleased that you might not have to talk extensively about transfers for once uh no it's always a pleasure to come and speak with you about any range of subjects moving on from the transfers good International break Nick just touched upon Sandro tonali there H his assist for Italy has gone a little bit viral on social media I'm sure you've seen it what did you make of it and how much does it represent the quality of the player that is Sandro tonali the fact he's able to do that yeah I mean it's uh something we've seen before um not that exact um piece of skill but it's typical Sandro he has that that flare and that ability to do things that um that can make the difference after say it was an outstanding finish as well it was a great team move um but he has the ability and I've always said that he's a player that we absolutely love it's good to see Paul Mitchell as well come out and speak to the media what did you kind of make of it from what you have seen of of the interview done with Paul and how important is it that there is that kind of transparency as well from from a sporting director at the club well I think it's really important that that uh as you say there is transparency from the club and the financial situation that we we have is not only discussed by me because that with all due respect to me I'm not a numbers and and figures guy I'm a football man so um that isn't my field of speciality and I don't pretend that it is so I think it's good that we have um different people communicating about those areas I remember you said a couple of months ago you needed to be happy you needed to be free to kind of do the work that you enjoy doing which is naturally on the coaching page I wonder kind of how you feel right now as we sit here at Newcastle United feel a little bit hot under these lights to be honest um no I feel good I'm very happy on the training pitch for me that's my um without being too soy that's my happiest environment um coaching helping the players being with them is what this job is all about and then of course you you enter sort of game day and you go into a different head space it's about competing and trying to win um but no I'm enjoying myself and I know elsewhere you've talked about the international break the players coming back from International break how else Newcastle looking injury wasse Joe willik for example Bruno obviously came off at 45 uh for Brazil against Paraguay as well yeah we hope Bruno's okay um no physical um ill effects from that game um Joe Will's improving yeah so he's we have seen him training this week albeit not full training but uh he's been with the group so positive signs for him man thanks thanks Andy NE morning Eddie um K trippier was one of the players that stayed with you uh during the break and he you know there's a lot of speculation about about his future over the summer and even after the window closed domestically how has he been this week and how do you see that battle for that right back position with Tino Leo is have you got even more of a headache uh no kieran's trained really well I've been pleased I think he needed a period of intense uh physical training which we've we've given him um very rare that we have him in these types of occasions usually is away with with England so obviously he's closed that chapter on his career but that's given him and us an ability now to work with him in different parts of his game and of course the physical being probably the biggest one for him currently um no but I've been pleased with him I think there's of course there's battle for places in we need it in every position not just the right back position but that is one that will be intriguing and of course I'll uh um have to make decisions on that as we go forward we've talked in these press conferences Lots about the away form and do you feel any closer to kind of unlocking what that block has been you know with these two big away games coming up um yeah I think it's just generally about performances I I know a lot is made of the home and way and of course we we've spoke about it internally um because our record last year wasn't what we needed it to be um so it's something think we're focusing on we're trying to address but for me it's not so much I don't think you can focus on where you're playing it's about the the product you produce and there's been areas of our game that we haven't been good enough um that we're we're working on and I think the signs are positive early season not necessarily as I said in terms of our overall performance but certain aspects of our game especially our defensive resilience early season's been very good we needed that in the away game against Bournemouth we're going to need it in these games coming up and just finally for me um how's Callum Wilson injury wise Callum is um he hasn't had a setback but he's a little bit behind where we wanted him to be um we envisage that he might be training at this moment in preparation for the games ahead he's not there yet so um he's probably a little bit behind where we hoped he would be sorry just St to follow up do you have any idea is it weeks away is it you know yeah there's no there's no as I said there's no um injury or reinjury it's a case of just doesn't feel like he can push uh that final part at the moment so hopefully in the coming weeks he will be but uh it's not going to be a long-term problem thank you thanks thanks broadcasters uh we'll move on to R we will do Sundays as well um just wary of time so if you don't have to ask two and three and four questions please don't and we'll try and squeeze as much as we can with with Sundays at the end we'll start with Daman Eddie there's been a lot of talk about the changes that happen at the club over the summer is it the lot of a head coach that you push for as much as you can get then whatever happens whether you plays or disappointed you just have to get on with it sorry I I missed the first part of that the over a transfer window as a head coach do do you have to push for as much as you can possibly get and then pleased or disappointed you've just got to get on with it is that the lot of the head coach um I don't think it works like that these days it may be in a bygone era it's it's about collaboration and communication and and talking through what we have available what we can do and then deciding where to go with with your decision making it's not about trying to squeeze more M because PSR raises its head and there they're the limitations that upon us not what someone's willing to spend so we're in a different situation to where we would be maybe 15 20 years ago um and it's about communicating which direction you want to go that that's that's the key thing and then trying to execute and get the deals done and again amid all the speculation was there any sense in which you were unsettled at all about what went on or is it is that just part of life as a as a head coach these days no it's part of life whether you get a player in or not that's that's part of being a manager I've always had that there's no guarantees to anything you can um think you're going to get a deal done and not and you have to get on with it and um I've said all along the the squad we have is a very good squad I love all the players we we have here and it's about getting the best out of them thanks Dam we got to Lee Rider and then Jordan crer morning Eddie um just on you know the the PSR thing again we've spoke about the Newcastle tax before will it get to a point where you just have to kind of like learn to cope with with teams putting prices up because the man United's and man cities of the world I guess they've got to do that as well if they want to get players through yeah I don't think I think the Newcastle tax was definitely there for us in our first this is just my personal experience of it in our first year where Big T take over big news we come in for a player and the price doubles but I I don't think that's there anymore cuz I think people know the realities of our situation we know we're not we're not changing the market with what we're doing we're in line with the market with everybody else so we definitely walked away from deals early on where we felt there was a Newcastle tax um but it all depends on your conditions and what type of play you're going for um it's certainly something that we we have encountered but I think it's maybe less relevant than it was and just done going back to a couple of years ago obviously getting into Champions League Newcastle have that brand of intensity that we all enjoyed to an extent are you close to getting that back now this season and do you have to get up to those levels of sharpness again if you want to stay where you are on the table Yeah I think that that's the style of play that we want here I think we um we want to play with a a clear plan we want the players to deliver a lot we ask a lot of them um I think they capable of delivering that I think our very best we're a very difficult team to play against I think we're searching for that that feeling that really good physical feeling um in the early weeks of the season I don't think we've quite seen it on a consistent basis some players have executed it some players maybe haven't yet but I'm sure they will and hopefully it will all come together for us thanks L Jordan hi can I just check on emel Craft I think you withdrew from the Sweden schols he for the weekend yeah he been nursing a problem um we have seing seen him in training he missed the um the training sort of towards the back end of last week in the early sessions of this week um but he's joined joined in in the last couple of days so we're hopefully he'll be okay and for good well as good as em has been how much have you missed Fabian sh and that sort of ability on the ball and has that been part of the reason why you haven't maybe had the possession that you would have wanted in the sort of first opening four games yeah I think definitely Fabian has his ball playing ability is unquestioned and um we have missed that aspect of his game but I think Emil's done an outstanding job I mean I can't compliment him enough especially when you consider that it's not his first position he's been playing Center half now for a while we started that work with him at sort of back end of last season where we saw that being a position that he could play and play very well um he did against Manchester United last year in the carabel cup in the game that we won there and he was magnificent that night so it's an area that we see Emil Maybe developing more as his career goes on with us um but having that dual role is key as you similar to say qualities that Lloyd Kelly has where he can play both positions um but fabian's unique and of course we've missed his um his outstanding qualities just one last one as well leis Miley how's has his how is his recovery going and when can you expect him to be back yeah he's doing well he's back on the grass it's great to see him with his boots on so that was the first time I think last week uh he's on track I'd say for the three months that he was given ini initially I don't see any big change from that currently okay we've got to Luke Chris and then Craig yes please um Joe willick is he back uh and what does he bring bring you as a as a manager in a team yeah he as I say he has trained he hasn't trained fully but he's he's trained with us he's done parts of the session um he's a big player for us when we started the game against not forest and you think we started electric Joe Joe scored a great goal team looks really good and then he goes off and um I thought our performance suffered from him exiting the pitch he brings that energy that pace into our Midfield um definitely got a knife a goal he's got a creative streak um and yeah he's a he's a real Energizer as well he's got a positive outlook on life and and football so we've definitely missed him an international break is often a time for for a manager to reflect um we've talked a lot in this room about what happened in the summer the changes at boardroom level what failed to happen what did happen in the transfer window when you sit there now how are you feeling about things and are you looking forward driving the back well it might be an opportunity for you to reflect it's certainly not necessarily for me I I think for me my eyes have been on wolves since the Tottenham game finished my eyes have been on the training um getting the best out of every single player that we were left with no no part of me sort of looks back to the the transfer window and all the stuff that obviously you guys write about on a daily basis and I understand why but for me my job is always about the future and tomorrow and so transferwise it's it's January all those discussions haven't taken place yet but football-wise it's on the next game Chris and more n sorry just another one on injuries just an update on house Fen botman and Jamal Asel are getting along I know the time scale was somewhere between sort of six and nine months I think we're at the early stages of that now so just when do you expect to see them back yeah I think both players shown a great attitude to their their injuries long road ahead for both of them they're sort of in the middle of that time now um both seem a lot more positive and I think it's natural when you first have the injury and you you sort of have the operation and you're in the early stages you can't do a lot there's a feeling of frustration and um uh I've been there as a as an athlete it's it's a difficult moment but when you start to do more and you get the heartbeat going and you get the physical work started you you feel so much better about yourself they're they're currently and slightly at different stages I say um sven's probably a little bit ahead of Jamal just in terms of their rehabs but both players committed to their work and doing great and just on uh the aw form me you mentioned that it's about performance more than anything else do you think there has been a mental aspect of that as well I mean at St james' Park obviously the form has has almost been consistent but do you think there has been a potential mental effect ofone away from home well I think it's more the the the inspiring aspect of St James James's Park is so big for us the the environment is so good it's so weighted in our favor that the supporters have been incredible that that that's elevated our levels with without a shadow of a doubt and then you go away the environment is different um the a support has been incredible um we need to reward that away support with more wins um a lot of that I think comes down to defensive performance if you're not conceding goals and you're in games I think we have the quality to um to take games in any situation so I think if we defend well first I think that would give us a great chance thanks Chris Craig and then Joe morning Eddie in Paul's interview last week he was very complimentary about you in terms of the coaching and the job you've done instead he was looking forward to building a good relationship with you he also said the transfer strategy he walked into wasn't fit for purpose you were a big part of that transfer strategy what did you make of those comments and do you agree was it not fit for purpose um I think I think if few things on that I think very very proud of every single player that we we signed in that period I think it's very easy to look back any transfer window and sort of make a judgment on the players that you've signed three years down the line but you have to go back to actually the situation we're in when when we're in those moments where you're in the relegation Zone and you're trying to recruit players that that's not a an easy thing to do you're also recruiting not just for the short term but for the long term and I think when you look back I think that that work was good because our objective was to stay in the league so I'm not going to critique every signing but I'm very very proud of the body of work that we did and and the players that we have now from those the legacy of those transfer windows and we love them to bits so I think it's about actually when you're in that moment the decisions that you made and um I think everyone can hold their heads up very high Paul also said that uni played a supporting role this summer which would give the impression that it was you and know they still sort of leading the transfer process was that the case uh I I don't think it's right for me to sort of make individual comments in in reply to Paul's press conference I don't think that's going to um help our current situation so I think it's best for me to focus on the future and just lastly have you spoken to Paul since last week I've had no contact from Paul um but I don't think that's unusual we're um got different jobs to do I'm focusing on the on the football and the team and he's obviously focusing on his role thank you sure hi Eddie um Anthony Gordon played again a big role for England um what have you made to his start start of the Season obviously there was speculation surround His future what have you made to his you know first four games with Newcastle this year I think Anthony is well firstly I think he's in a great place after the the two England games I thought he performed really well um I was watching totally biased towards him and hoping he had you know really good games and impacted and I know he's very proud to play for his country so I know that those two games would have meant a lot to him and the trust given to him by the manager was was great to see so um I think he come back in a great place and I think he probably needed the games to build his Fitness levels up again very difficult summer for him where um finished the tournament with England very minimal training before he's come back to us so I hope we see a much um fitter Anthony in the in the coming games and Gordon as part of the front three with isach and Harvey Barnes as well they started against Tottenham is that one that you can see going forward because it's certainly one that supporters have you know got excited about I think we've got good options um I think of course that that game was bespoke to Tottenham and um yeah so that was a sort of a a a reshuffle on system and Personnel this game against wolves will be different so we'll um see what we do there thanks John go to Simon bird and then to k sorry Hi um last week Paul Mitchell also said that the scouting system wasn't fit for purpose um why do you think you said that and did you agree I I think that's for Paul to answer I don't know if I can answer for him um The Scouting structure was there and whatever you think about the structures I thought the results were very good from from answerers to Craig it seems that you're kind of unhappy with some of the things that were were said last week and you don't want to respond to them publicly is that will he respond to them privately is is that possible I think you're slightly putting words into my mouth there um I just don't think it's the time or the place to do that yeah one of the um one of the questions some of the fans said the read the reading stuff which says there's a civil war internally within the club do you want to respond to that and say that that's not true um or or elaborate at all it does seem there's tension and there's a narrative surrounding the club at the minute which is kind of unsettling the Civil War stuff I uh yeah absolutely not in in in my experience um but I'm cocooned in my work and absolutely focused on the players and the training and and I know you're bored of that answer for me but that is what I do um every single day that I'm here so I don't involve myself in politics it's for me this job is very much about the players that we have um and trying to make the supporters proud every time we play everything else around that um I try not to get involved in okay C morning Eddie um the chairman was at the game a couple of weeks ago I was just wondering what you took from the meeting you you had when after the game and you feel the ambition still very much there from the top yeah it's always very um Chairman's always very engaging he's a really positive guy so I think he always wants to try and help affect us in in a in a in a good way um he's very keen to communicate and help um so yeah nothing but positives of course helped by the result and everyone was in a good mood so um good start to the season so it was very positive I think it's a mixture I think it's never about the market it's always about the player so we'll always assess or we have historically always assessed the the player first and then of course has to be attainable has to be at the right price um but it's never about looking at one market and going we're going to sign a player from this Market only it's about the position positional need and then trying to identify the right player regardless of where they play um I don't know if that will change in the future but that's how we've done it thanks Karen we'll go to Louise and then finish with Martin in this section hi hi Louise imagine something called a bromance barometer with 10 is you're completely bonded and not that a bit Frosty um where on the Bromance barometer is your relationship with paor Mitchell I don't really understand the uh the fascination with our with our Bromance but I I I don't think it has to be that way I I think it has to be a collaboration and it has to be you know sometimes there is moments I I fall out with Jason a lot um if you want to talk about bromances and that's probably the closest one I've got at the club um but we fall out a lot we we have healthy debate and argument and that that's never been a problem that's as long as it's respectful and it's it's for the greater cause which is always the football club and making sure we try and get positive results there's no issues with that but I think the the collaboration part is the key thing and it's got to be teamwork for the ultimate aim I mean in in Paul Mitchell's chat with us he said that he was actually talking to you more than his wife and talking for an hour every night so obviously that's ended now has it well well it seemed like you were but obviously that's during the height of the the transfer window um and that's natural no it's it's definitely not regular no transfer window related Martin to finish hi Eddie um without putting words into your mouth could you have shot much better in terms of age and increasing value when you look at Bruno gz Sven botman Anthony Gordon Alexander isach and potentially the lik Sandra tarale and Harvey Barnes um I as I said earlier I'm very very proud of those signings and I would I've said all along I think in in press conferences that I don't want to make it about old structure and new structure but those signings obviously I played a huge part in and uh I took ownership of all those signings I said that and here even if they're good bad I'll I'll take ownership of that because ultimately I was always the the final decision maker on those signings and I was very proud to sign those players I think they've been brilliant signings for the the where we were and the long-term future of the club and I really believe in them and I still do so um you've asked me a question I I'll always try and answer it if I can um openly and honestly um I'd certainly like to find a few more of them if we could and there was a lot of work went into those transfer Windows wasn't there in terms of the medy and but also the longterm uh future of the club well I think that that's the balance I think you you can't that we were in a relegation battle so yes a couple of those signings were more shortterm in that moment because you needed instant results um relegation was not something we could contemplate but always in the back of my mind with with every signing I try to make it's always about yes C can they impact the team now but will they impact the team in the right uh in the right way in the future and sometimes there's a bigger positional need for the here and now and sometimes you're buying a player for thinking well in a year's time he could turn into be a regular starter for us so there's loads of things that go into it it's never as clear or as easy as everyone thinks um but the the key thing now is the future and make making sure we get future transfer Windows right cuz because ultimately that is the most important thing at any club because for you to be successful you have to recruit well okay thanks Mar do quick one just one Eddie on January when would you expect those discussions and planning to start um pretty soon I imagine I think you have to um be organized you have to be very thorough in your in your preparation to make sure you know what you want um and of course we need to see what we can and can't do financially
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,ltN7WVd_B04,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltN7WVd_B04,before we get to anything else can you give us an update please on Joe Willock yeah Joe had a scan yesterday which is an early scan usually I think we'd leave it a little bit longer um relatively good news on the scan don't think it's a a serious injury so but it is early so I am sort of half you know we will rescan again I think in a few days time just to confirm that but it doesn't look too bad at the moment and is it his thigh yes um transfer window closes at 11:00 tonight will you be bringing anybody in uh I I don't know currently um there is still time and there is still work going on to try and see what we can do in the last few hours of the window um so while there's time there's hope so as we speak on Friday morning you're not closed for business in or out no I don't think we'd be closed right till the end um in both ways so that may be one or two of the younger players going out um we're looking for loans for two or three of those um so let's see what happens in the last few hours how frustrating has the last week or the last few days of the transfer window been because there is a possibility that nobody comes in yeah there is um I think with such short time left um it it is looking difficult I think yeah this window as I said many times has been difficult um continues to be difficult for us we're in a a really difficult situation with um the PSR situation and um available funds attracting the right players and the players that we think can make a difference that's such a a delicate spot for us we've got to try and hit it right and if we don't then probably doing nothing is um as frustrating as that that is is probably the best option if you have to go into the next part of the season with the squad that you have now based on what you've just said there um will you be happy or will you still feel that some of the needs that you've had this summer haven't been addressed and it it could be a risk yeah a bit of both Razer to be honest a bit of both I think there'll be a feeling that um we have a good squad um and we like all the players that we have in our Squad but there is a feeling of course that there's a a few areas of the squad that we felt we needed to strengthen um so I think we carry those emotions depending on what happens in the last few hours couple of questions about the match on Sunday Spurs coming to St james' Park and like you they are unbeaten after two Premier League games four points what do you um make of the way they've played in their opening fixtures yeah very good um they continue to be a team that I like to watch very attractive style uh very fluid different with their fullbacks and and how they play so yeah I'm I'm a big fan I think they've recruited well too I've gone youth for um but they've signed some really talented younger players of course Dominic sank is someone we know really well I think he's an outstanding player so I think they were good last year but I think they've added quality so I think they'll be even better this season but you've got good recent memories of this fixture haven't you um who knows what way it will go on Sunday but the 61 and the 4-0 they were special days for you great results Great Performances too yeah they were I mean two two great days for us I think last year contrasting games against Tottenham you had the away game that was really disappointing and then the home game which was equally um was good the other way um I think we've always had entertaining games against him I think the two teams that Styles create those types of games now for us we've got to make sure that we get on top of the details and we um have the same mindset that we did last season where our commitment to what we were trying to do was was excellent we were really ruthless and efficient on the day with the chances that came we we took them and um yeah we look back fondly but of course that counts for nothing in this one thanks Matthew Nick Eddie just on um Kieran trippier announced his International retirement obviously on Friday um a player you know you you've managed for for a lot of years now um what do you make of that decision and um it kind of feels like a could look like maybe a bit of a Changing of the Guard we've SE o liento getting a first call up as well um how how do you view that decision well if it was right for Kieran that's you know that's the most important thing and he's no doubt thought long and hard about his um decision and yeah we back it totally I think it's a time for celebration really of what he achieved for England what he did um the early part of his England career I was watching from afar and really proud because the player that I knew from signing him at Burnley um developed into a full International and uh an outstanding player at various World Cups and European Championship so um was really proud to see how he'd taken his career to that level and then of course latly starting to work with him against all the qualities and he continued to Excel on the international scene so I think he should be really proud of everything that he's he's done uh and looked back with some with some really great memories sure you described your players as ruthless going back to April and that 4-nil Victory against Tottenham you know doubt you're looking for the same performance on Sunday yeah it' be a different game I think as always teams evolve we evolve they they evolve so I think it'll be a different game but I think um the fundamentals of that performance in terms of our attitude to the game and and what we delivered that day against a very good technical team was was really good um so yeah you don't always get uh everything going in your favor as it did that day we scored two really quick goals which changed the momentum of the match but Tottenham in that game showed their qualities and showed their their technical delivery is of a really high level so we're going to have to be um it goes without saying in the Premier League but have to be at our very best to win thanks Nick Andy on um there was a lot of talk after Wednesday night after the League Cup about the format of the draw I just wondered if you had any thoughts on that as well given the do we call it seedings these days or no it's really interesting because um I had no idea what was going on so I think yeah but I didn't even know that there was a change so I only saw I was with Lee after the game um leak and vouch for this we just caught the very tail end of the draw and saw us um uh saw our draw but I didn't know what had happened initially just moving on to another player Sandro Tali obviously you've talked about the players support for him we'll come back to that in a second but the fan support you saw that at the end I'm told that war flags are going to be doing a little bit in support of him obviously his first home game back at 36 days I think it is I just wonder what you thought ahead of Sunday and a potential show support like that for him yeah yeah I mean I I said after the game I was so pleased to see the number of Italian flags that obviously in support of Sandro um and you could feel the warmth from the from the away fans to towards him and you could feel the genuine love and affection and and also I think the the key thing here is you can see the outpouring emotion from Sandro to the supporters at the end of the game and I think that's just quite rare to see these days when players get emotional but for Sandro there would have been a huge release on Wednesday um he would have been bottling a lot of things up which you have to you know you have to conduct yourself in a certain way um dayto day um but he would have loved being back on the football pitch you you've talked about how the players have shown support for him over the last 10 months or so can you kind of give us any examples of how they've shown support I know Sandra referenced Bruno referenced Joe Linton as well have you witnessed any kind of shaes of support for him uh yes I have and I've I've I've witnessed lots of things which has been great to see from the group coming together and sort of supporting someone in a really difficult moment I always think that's inspiring um I don't think it's right for me to maybe go into too much detail on that but I see it on a daily basis also how some of the players of course Sandra will be closer to some players than other that's that's just how it is in in a football squad have really uh shared the burden with him and and kept him positive when he's no doubt been uh having a difficult day um so we've seen all that first at hand and that's the beauty of being in a team sport you're you're not isolated you're not alone and um that's been vital for Sandra I ask you this at the end of every transfer window but how delighted are you to see the back of this one in particular given everything that's happened I just wonder what lessons do you think that Newcastle as a club can learn from Miss window being difficult in your words um well I think the emergence of PSR as sort of I don't I don't think it for a lot of football clubs and we're not alone in that I think the actual um workings of the windows totally changed but I think it took time for everyone to realize how that would change and certainly for me as the manager it's um you know when you're spending 90% of your time on the training pitch with the players and then to this new Dynamic to totally throw everything um that you're doing change the way you're recruit players is a big shift so I think I think through time people and if the rules remain the same will'll get used to um to that but it's obviously a change for us but it's of course a change for everybody media supporters because transfer business I and under its current format will never be the same again just one on on Spurs on Sunday you talk about the kind of fundamentals of newcast United not change one of those fundamentals is obviously the intensity the high intensity how do you you get that intensity that level of intensity that you showed at times last season at St james' Park back this season and back on Sunday do you think yeah I think it's something you have to protect and work towards every single day because it's the players can't just turn up and perform that way uh in isolation so it's something we hone and work on continuously it is related of course to our fitness you have to be really really super fit to deliver that style of play for 90 minutes so um that's something I think we're working towards it said it's no secret we've got a group of players that probably aren't at their absolute Optimum Fitness wise I think the international break providing that those players that are a little bit short of where they need to be stay with us if they don't then we're under no control of that um but very quickly we've got to find our best physical levels to produce that style of play and of course the crowd are important in that because I think they elevate our levels from sort of here to to hear when we're all in tune and um on the same page just very very finally we're from football uh a new Castle United fan called Matty Smith is uh doing ultramarathons from every single between every single Premier League club I think it's something like 800 miles over the course of 26 days he finishes at St james' park today it's all in Aid of Suicide Prevention I just wonder what you kind of as a new Cass United manager made of of such a feat and obviously such a cause as well well yeah I mean that's an incredible feat by the sound of it you'd have to repeat it for me to fully understand it but um that sounds like a lot of a lot of running and a lot of physical preparation needed I think the cause most importantly is absolutely vital I think um that is something I really am passionate about um supporting because I think you see it with a lot of the young men in particular um really high rates of suicide and it's something that we'd love to to change uh and I'd certainly be vocal in supporting that thanks Eddie thanks Andy Nisha morning Eddie morning um Talk numberous times about this difficult window but it changes hour to hour dayto day but were you expecting more business to have been done by this point by the club um I think expecting I don't know is the right word hopeful yeah of course because I think when we start out and you're going into the window you know there's there's various parts of the squad that needed needed looking at and needed work and needed to try and uh improve um but it's the same wish I will say this numerous times it's the same wish for any sorry everybody working internally for newcar so there's no one part that's going no we don't want to support that we do um all together and we want to find the right Solutions but they've got to be the right Solutions I think the worst thing we can do is bring the wrong players into the football club that would that would harm us for a long time so it's always about the right players and if you can't find the right players then um probably best to do nothing your focus is this club but when you look at say clubs like West Ham and Brighton the business they've been doing and how they are going to be pushing around where you want to be is that a concern for you if it doesn't go your way today of course because I think if your competition are improving um and getting stronger and you're not that that's a that's a huge concern um but again Brighton historically have sold sold players they put brought in a lot of Revenue and and income and we haven't so we're we're in a difficult situation regarding PSR and that is the major problem for us that we can't um do what other teams are doing currently and yes if that makes the challenges harder for us and that makes it harder for me but that's the environment we're in and we have to try and find a way to to still be successful a window is as much about keeping your big players as it is about bringing bring new ones in you still confident that you will keep th those big plays for your team like you and tripier like Miguel Alan I hope so with um the length of time we have left because if we were to lose anybody now it' be very difficult to replace them so um I don't envisage anything happening regarding any of the established players in the squad between now and the end of the window and just finally for me I you do have quite a lot of goalkeepers at the moment and um Martin Deka mentioned on social media it was a post that referenced being stressed about his job have you spoken to him and how are you managing all those goalkeepers you have at the moment I've got no knowledge of the thing that you're talking about with Martin Martin seems in a good place um he's had concussion um so that's something we've been monitoring due to a training ground collision with a player um but hopefully he's um nearing a full return to to Fitness um the goalkeeper situation is is fine um I think there's a good team team of goalkeepers there that are working and pushing each other daily thank you thanks Nisha written guys we'll try and uh add in some Sundays as well so if you don't have to ask a question during this section and please uh try and avoid it start with Damian hi Eddie hi Daman Eddie Newcastle broke in the top six two seasons ago vill did it last season but do you think PSR is preventing a club from doing that on a sustained basis probably making it more challenging I'd say I think it all depends on your income and your Revenue stre and how how much you can improve those in a really short period of time now we're finding it it difficult due to um a number of reasons um that someone better qualified than me can give you more direct answers um but the reality is it is difficult for us to recruit players currently and it has been in this window and probably will be for a few future windows I think beyond that the the future should be brighter but PSR is probably hitting us more shortterm in the here and now than it will do hopefully in the future given all the caveats you've mentioned about this window earlier if you weren't to bring anyone else in today there's an argument that the squad is perhaps weaker than it was at the start of the summer what would your view be on that I think you can make an argument for that I I can't um I'm not going to fight you too much on that because it's all opinion based I think all I can do is say that we will try and get the very best out of the squad that we have and that that is my job and it's always been the way that I've looked at it you can't control everything you can't um you can't do things you can't do so what you can do is get the very very best and try to get the very best out of every single person in the squad and maximize their ability and your ability um that's always how I've seen the job as managing and coaching and um we gladly take on that challenge thanks Damon we go to Lee and then Craig Eddie just on your mess message to the supporters there obviously a lot of frustration already there on the prospect of not bringing anyone in what would you sort of relay to the fans on that yeah I understand and I share it and that's is why I say we're all in it together I think from ownership to me to the supporters we need one United cause uh and the cause has to be against everybody else that we're playing what we can't do as a football club is tear ourselves apart you know we have to be United now uh more than ever so that starts from me to the board as I say to the supporters and however I say challenging the conditions but however um whatever frustration people will feel it's the biggest thing is for me to get behind the players and try and help the players in every way and then of course on Match days the supporters as they have done since day one since I've been here do the same and I think we're a formidable Force when we are linked together and really strong in United I mean is for you is there any kind of personal frustration because you have obviously put a lot of hours off the train and Fielding on recruitment is there any personal frustration for you or do you just have to kind of move on from it quickly yeah there has been of course um as you say is the hours that you put in for in in this part of the job the hours you put in for what you sometimes get back it can be hours and hours of watching players to only find out you can't do the deal that that goes with the territory and you sort of understand that there's been no lack of trying from anyone connected with the club it's been it's been there the effort's been there um but I think I've learned through time to sort of shut down quite quickly when you can't do something and the option doesn't become available anymore you concentrate on what you can control which is the Players we have here they're always the most important people just on on the game itself obviously we've had a very decent start four points from six is this the first kind of acid test though going in against one of the potential top four contenders I think every game's an AET test there is no easy games we found that at Bournemouth very very difficult game um I think we've done well to get four points so far because we haven't been at our absolute best that's a good sign but we're going to need to be at our absolute best against Tottenham to get anything thanks Lee Craig morning Eddie when we sat down with you in Germany you said that your happiness was perhaps dependent on the new working Dynamic behind the scenes where are you at with that and if you finish the window without anyone else coming in how will you reflect are you happy I think the two things are totally separate my happiness against what we're able to do in the transfer market they're two totally different things um I am enjoying my work I am happy um it is a challenging period no doubt about that we haven't had the uh the window that we wanted to have no no denying that um but my job is to continue to give my best for the players we have here the pursuit of mar was obviously a lot of it was played out in public why hasn't that happened do you think why hasn't that deal been able why hasn't it been possible I'm still not going to comment an individual deals that's not fair to other players other clubs I don't think it's right and will you how is that Dynamic you know you use that word in Su with us Dynamic how has that Dynamic worked that new Dynamic which one behind the scenes in terms of the new working relationships yeah I mean look we we're we're working well um and and in respect to our relationships and um I think that's fine there's no issues there of course turning that into transfers that that's i' think I've said all summer that I'm not involved in negotiations of players that is separate to me me um so hopefully I've answered your question thanks Craig got the Chris and then Luke more Eddie I know you said you don't want to talk about individuals but there's been a lot of talk about one specific player has it all been a case of just one player you've been looking at have there been Alternatives that you've tried to sign um without going into the individual uh situation here we've tried to sign several players um yes never been about one one player it can never be about one player because as soon as you're in that position then um your negotiation uh strength is over so no we've tried for several targets um but it has still has to be the right player though um and there is an unlimited number of players it's not like you can well we'll just go on to the next one the next one the next one because then the quality dilutes and then you have to question whether you're doing the right thing for the long-term future of the club there isn't a bottomless pit of money uh we're not able to spend that way everything that we do has a long-term consequence so you got to be you got to be very sure whatever you do do is is right for the long-term future and short-term future of the club and you said heading into the summer that at the point at that point there wasn't a sport director and that the transfer committee would just work as normal obviously the the new sport director came in at the start of July but would have would having had a sportting director early earlier and going in that period do you think that would have made it an easier window uh yeah you can't deal in hypotheticals possibly yes but um we just have to deal with the reality of what it was thanks Chris Luke sometimes there are difficult press conferences as Newcastle United manager and this this is probably one of them and I also appreciate there's probably other people at the football club who could maybe answer this and hopefully they they will in due course but I think for the first time supporters feel like the club has has failed a little bit in this transfer window what is your response to that please yeah I can't I'm not going to sit here and go it's been a brilliant transfer window for us I think everyone would to look at me and think not sure he's telling the truth and I do try as far as I can to tell the truth um but it's not been through the want of trying from from anybody's perspective and I think to sort of for me to sit here and say that would be totally wrong as well everyone has tried really really hard to improve the squad to make sure we got a chance of success and I don't want to repeat myself to previous questions either but you'll understand it has to be the right player at the right price we could easily be sitting here with four or five signings but if they're all the wrong players um that doesn't do anyone any favor either so it is a difficult balance and yes it's been a tough window and if it Remains the Same now now we we'll we'll crack on regardless and and try and have a great season um while learning the lessons of of what's happened I think one of the other things and Craig has alluded to it and Chris if this all these eggs all in one basket so-called approach would you refute that was actually happening that you've always had other options absolutely um but I'm never going to tell you what they are and you'll understand that's fine why that will be the case but it's never about one player we've tried for numerous players but as I said there's not a bottomless pit of names I will say that at the same time um but there wouldn't be for any other club in our position there's probably four or five players that you go through and once you get to the end of that you're then going is this player of sufficient quality you don't sorry you don't win or lose a season in the transfer window you don't win a transfer window what sort of season are you still aiming to have regardless of transfers in or out yeah and that's important to remember because it the games are one on the pitch now of course the transfer windows are to give you a better chance percentage wise of success by bringing in better players but I am going to repeat myself in the sense that the most important people we have at this football club are in the dressing room now about to prepare to train it's about the players you have here and making sure they're in the right mental and physical condition to play and give their best if we can get everyone at their absolute Peak we've got a really good good squad don't think everyone is at their absolute Peak at the moment and our job is to try and get them there um and to try and get some of our injured players back fit as quickly as possible so we've still got the legacy of the long-term injured from last year so we we're in a we're in a position where if we can be successful now and we can start the season really well we'll only get stronger I think throughout the season than we've got hands raised from everyone in the room so if you can avoid two and three and four questions um we'll still try and fit Sundays in got to and then Jordan morning Eddie since playing in the Champions League the club have now had two transfer Windows without arguably making a major signing with player trading so important to the progress of clubs we still satisfied the club are moving in the right direction yeah when you put it like that it's uh but that that's the reality that we've the position that we've been in um but as I said it's through the rules really that that that is so Stark it's not through the club not wanting to do anything um yeah so I think I've already answered the rest of it has the club taken risks in terms of PSR that the now experiencing the consequences of uh no I don't think so I I think if you go back to when I first came to the club PSR wasn't really talked about is only something that's become really relevant I think with the points deductions that some of the clubs suffered last year that's brought brought it home to everybody how important it is not to uh breach PSR and how important that aspect of the game is and now that continues to sort of be the narrative that we we can't escape short term so uh what can we do with that situation we have to be very very smart with what we do we have to be very careful with what we do right now because for future windows we could be hamstrung if we make the wrong decision so there's a lot that goes into it it's not as clear as maybe everyone thinks it is okay Jordan hi Edie you mentioned the PSR situation but were the club able to commit a substantial amount of money to sign a player this summer uh yes but it had to be absolutely the the right player and of course the more the windows gone on um the right player becomes very hard to to find but you've also got to understand that with that decision impacts future windows and it impacts our PSR situation drastically so I think you then you'll understand the importance of every decision that you're making and if you're not uh absolutely certain on this being the right direction to take you can't take it and you'll have to make that decision another day and just on the squad as a whole do you feel you're in a stronger position than you were 12 months ago or do you feel like you fell short on that department uh no I'm going to be I'm going to be positive um if we can get some of the injured players back that we have even currently I think the squad's in a really good good position and that's a big if because those players aren't back yet um and we've just lost Joe willick who was a massive player and someone that we thought we did have back so it's an everchanging situation but I do back the players that we have and my message is we need a United Football Club on every front I'm not going to go away from that and that's that's everyone that's you guys as well please because it makes such a difference the the narrative can't be that we're uh in a difficult situation The Season's just started we've got everything to achieve thanks Jordan go to Mark and then Ian Eddie you mentioned uh about PSR and actually the transfer window changing forever does that mean maybe clubs need to not ask as much money as they are for certain players because the market itself is being distorted by this well I think clubs will always ask for whatever they want it's like when you're selling your own house no one's going to dictate the price to you um you'll dictate your own price whether that changes Through Time whether that that means transfer fees will come down it doesn't necessarily look like it I think the market has changed but maybe there's not the number of players moving for for smaller fees but the bigger fees seem to be as big as ever um but again I'm not an expert on that uh but it has changed and I think it will continue to change as we everyone gets to grips with PSR fully and um yeah let's see what the future brings on that but I think it's uh a changing environment I know you don't want to talk about um specific deals but was it a case that with the Target or one of your big targets that you didn't have the PSR headro to go to that or was it that you looked at the price that it went to and thought we can maybe that's going to impact us too much over time or was it that you just didn't have the PSR head room to do that full stop or did you take a decision a longer term decision a combination all Ian my question for the Sundays actually well yeah we'll move on then kieren suay as well no yeah welcome to you in a second Karen um Eddie what lessons have been learned this summer you talking what you talking what subject I suppose in general has this window taught you guys a lot about the workin going forward into future windows so maybe that this situation might not happen again I don't know I don't know cuz we're working under a quite rigid conditions so I don't know if there's any lessons to learn it's more the the conditions that we're working in rather than relationships that's fine it's more the situation that we're in you mentioned a what a right player is for you um it's a very obvious question what what does that mean um in your words well I think the right player yeah I mean it's probably a good question the right player is multifactored really I think it's the right age the right deal um as in transfer fee the right wages um then the right player to actually come into your squad the right positional need loads of loads of things and if one of those things isn't right um especially financially for us that puts us in a difficult position okay Louise hi Eddie um firstly and just could you clarify one thing please I asked you on Tuesday about Sandro Tali having to make 16 trips to Italy in the next eight months which you said wouldn't be interfering with his um schedule and that appears it won't interfere with his schedule because he's already made them is that actually the case were you being a little bit disingenuous I wasn't being disingenuous at all I'm not up to date with how many trips Sandro has made to Italy and what what further trips he has to make so has he got some more to make I don't know do you know Le I don't know Louise uh Simon um I've actually got another question um have you been obviously it's been a stressful difficult transfer window have you had Direct conversations with the with the Saudi owners and have they sort of offered you reassurances and explanations as to as to why this is happening but there's no explanations needed the situation is based on PSR as I have said so I don't need an answer to that the the rules are creating that issue for us and we're trying to work them within the conditions that the rules have set thanks Lis Simon I it's probably most difficult press conference you've had in your time here um but another question on on the transfers 14 months ago the P PF chairman said that the club wanted to be number one selling the fans kind of an ambitious dream have the have the fans been sold a false dream about what's happened this summer um and how can you possibly take the club to number one if you're not getting a big signing every every window I think um when pif took the club over and I don't want to speak to P for pif because I think that that's very very difficult to do but I think the landscape was different then to to it is now I think A lot's changed in that period of time in terms of PSR and I don't want to keep talking about it but I have to because I think that's been the biggest change the inability to to spend um and our need to comply within the rules or we Face points deduction so I think um that's been the biggest thing for them and I think of of course that impacts the ability to progress to Club as quickly as maybe they wanted to but I don't think the dream dies necessarily but I think it takes a lot longer we've got to build our revenue streams that is the biggest thing we've got to bring more money into the football club however we do that through player sales through sponsorship through loads of various things that's the big thing that that we need to focus on now for the next probably 10 years um whether I'm lucky enough to see any of that who knows but I think so the dream's not over it's just going to take a lot lot longer one of the arguments F would come back to you on that is um why haven't the Saudis with the multiple companies their own um driven sponsorships harder with with their own involving their own companies possibly not one for you but Pro probably not one for me because I could make a mistake because I'm not fully and you'll understand why it's very intricate I think there are rules in place to stop that so there there's rules everywhere to to stop clubs growing as quickly as we would want to okay that concludes this section and we'll have to be sorry Martin yet hi Eddie has this been your most hands off window since you've been to the club and if it has has that been frustrating for you uh yeah probably has um but you'd have to understand in the majority of the other windows it it's just been the whole structure of the club's been very different um so that's not necessarily A criticism of the structure we have now it's just there's different personalities and it's there's a different way of working now so yes it probably has been the most hands-off I've been um but that's not necessarily a negative but has that been a little bit frustrating and have you had to get used to that it's just a different way of working and you kind of alluded this already but how do you keep momentum going without um a player coming into the club in a window that doesn't make the team better um it's something I've been used to previously as I said my journey in in coaching and management was never about recruiting players to make your team better it was all about coaching to make your team better that that's always been my philosophy now I know that changes I'm not stupid as you get to clubs the size of Newcastle and um an era when there's a lot of pressure to bring in players but still at my core is coaching is my belief this is the most powerful tool you have so it's a time for me to go to work on the training pitch and when you you can feel there's a different mood around the city regarding the club because of this window how is the mood amongst the players at the minute probably mirrors being honest probably mirrors The Narrative created and it's again it's my job to um shape that as in the most powerful way that I can what I mean by that is there's been a number of unsettled players during this window it's not been a clear window window for us in terms of just bringing players in it's been difficult the other way as well so I think once the window shuts I think we'll have Clarity the players will have Clarity right we're all here now together for the same aim and then I'd like to think that we will all go together um until January in a pursuit of excellence and in a pursuit of success and we have some brilliant characters in the squad we do have a great changing room um so there's no criticism of the the changing room is just it has been unsettling and has been um that's always difficult when the Situation's like that
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,X_LhTWtx28w,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_LhTWtx28w,welcome to today's press conference ahead of the caraba cup second round tie at notam Forest we'll start with Matthew as usual then sky and then BBC thanks uh hi Eddie good morning um final day of Sandro tali's 10-month ban from competitive football so firstly can you confirm whether he'll be in your squad for notingham Forest tomorrow yeah definitely be in the squad um providing com through training today and how would you assess his Fitness levels as he nears a comeback to play yeah he's fit um um he just hasn't had the match the bigger space is the 11 V1 that every footballer will tell you is the the most important thing really the game the game time but he's done everything else um he's completed all of training for a long period of time he's worked incredibly hard with the sports science team to be on top of his Fitness and make sure that he's fitter than when um than when he got banned how do you think he's feeling I'd imagine there's a range of emotions I mean probably a lot of excitement a lot of of you feel like you're probably the next stage of his career really I think when you have a a long period of time like he's had out you have a lot of time to think and analyze and to reflect I'm sure he's done all of those things and now it's just he's doing what he loves which is playing football and that would be an incredible release for him that'll obviously be a lot of attention on him at Nottingham Forest and maybe in the the first few weeks after he comes back how do you ensure and how important is it that you ensure that he's not affect Ed by any external pressures I think it's the same for all the players to be honest I think the the the microscope is on everybody uh and it will be on Sandro for a period of time I think he understands that we understand that I think it's it's small steps I think for us we don't we just expect him to be himself and play his game he's a very intelligent footballer he's a very good technician um he has to play to his strengths and not try to do anything out of out of the ordinary really and that will be huge effective for us how are you going to work it at Nottingham Forest in terms of using your squad yeah we'll look at it today I mean I think we'll try and play a really strong team we want to progress um we will make changes as well at the same time because we have a squad that I think enables me to do so while not um while not weakening the quality you saw the strength of our bench on Sunday which made a huge difference so think there's a lot players that are very eager to show what they can do so I think it's an ideal opportunity to do that and it's a competition that remains hugely important to you as a manager but also to the club isn't it no it is and we're determined to try and do well I think we've had that Focus ever since I've been here to do well in or try and do well in every competition now this competition has been good for us last year we were Incredibly Close to another semifinal and that was uh that was a bit of a low point in our season really because we were so close the season before of course we reached the final so we got good memories of the competition and we want to do well last thing for me if things had been different Elliot Anderson May well have been in your team for this match um he made the move to Forest in the summer he's played in both their league games I imagine it'll be good to see him but um I think it's probably been a difficult situation hasn't it that move in the the manner in which it happened for him yeah I mean everything that you've said there's 100% correct um watching their game in preparation for this was uh it was good to see Elliot play so well against Southampton I thought he was excellent he really contributed to their winning performance in Midfield showed his versatility I thought he did really well but it was tinged with sadness for me because we've lost an outstanding not just player but person as well from the group we wish him well um but of course we''ll be competing against him in this game thanks Matthew if you could just use your microphone click them on and off for each question thank you morning Peter sorry can you click your microphone on please for your question it's on yeah this one's working this one working okay yeah yeah can't hear you um before I talk Newcastle can I ask you at Sven everybody seem in football seems to be paying tribute to to the man this morning what are your thoughts please yeah very sad news uh very sadden it's it seemed very sudden um so yeah thoughts to his family um a great football man you look back at his career wow what you know what a what a career he had everywhere he went I think he was loved and I think that's been an outpouring of emotion upon his um passing um but yeah Thoughts with his family I think he had a great affection for Newcastle dney I'm sure he he visited St James's Park on a number of occasions he had he had quite a bond with the club yeah I'm I'm not necessarily aware of that but um an unbelievable football man and I think when you look at the jobs that he had and the pressures that those that comes with those jobs um and the success he had it's a career of um great memories I'm sure for him um and his family and a great time to reflect back to Newcastle not long to go now before the window closes any Joy at all in either keeping players or or bringing players in well yeah at the moment keeping players is a success um as I sit here today um in terms of incomings no work still going on behind the scenes few days left I think everyone's um trying their best to improve the squad and yeah we wait and see what happens with the next few days the mark gay story doesn't seem to go away are you still hopeful or have you given up on Mark I'm not going to comment on individual players and Kieran where are you with Kieran because there was a lot of speculation about Kieran wanting away um he seemed to relish coming on at halim on Sunday um does is that a an encouraging sign for you absolutely I think when you look at his performance on Sunday that was a performance of someone that was focused and and ready to help the team I thought he did in every aspect I thought all the substitutes did um enhanced our performance but it's kieran's experience and his noow on the pitch um seem to have a galvanizing effect on the group so I was very pleased with his impact more talks with him this week then only football talk that there' be there'd be no need for any other talk I think he's um I think he's in a good place and finally can I ask you everybody in this room has been talking about Oasis big fan can't say anything other can I it's uh uh yeah I was actually in the uh in the 90s I I did enjoy their music I bought a lot of the the big albums and yeah it was the blur and Oasis rivalry was a great thing to experience actually and I liked both bands so I'm going to sit right on the fence on that one um but no I enjoyed their music got ticket I might have to speak to a couple of contacts if I can I think my wife's desperate to go thank you thank you hi Eddie uh in terms of Nots Forest tomorrow how big a challenge will they be for new C night yeah big challenge I think um they start the season well and from the games that we've watched deservedly got the the points that they have I think you've seen a slow Evolution under Nuno to very effec effective counterattacking Style with a lot of pace in their team uh good physicality in their team so I think we're prepared for yeah another difficult game it always is the city ground I think we've had a couple of good results recently since going there but very difficult ground great atmosphere and I know both teams will want to progress in an important competition for for both of us so um they'll be confident we' be confident I think it's a set up to be a good game how are you going to counter their threat well I think we have to do slightly better than we did against Bournemouth in a few of the details so um certainly uh we're looking for an improved performance generally but I thought there was a lot of good things in our last performance but some stuff that we still have to work on and and get better at um I think always when you go away from home you're looking at the mentality first and you're looking at how we approach the game and our desire to win that's got to be as strong as it needs to be um you know the group I think did really well in the battling qualities in the first two games but you want to see a bit more technical quality and where would you put your aspiration in terms of carabar Cup in terms of this season whereas it rank in terms of League FA Cup European aspirations yeah I don't rank them um they're all the same they're all um the most important game is the next one um there is no prioritizing in terms of competitions we want to try and win every game thank you Lee Ryder that's one way of putting it I prefer to say tactical switches um yeah I think we have a stronger Squad to pick from currently and and the challenge for us is to keep that throughout the season um as you go through through different campaigns and of course this week we have a three- game week which always reduces extra demands so the strength of the squad is hugely important the ability to make tactical changes during games you see something different um but of course you're riant on the attitude of the players and the quality of the players that come on the pitch to try and make the difference and sometimes that's more difficult um some weeks and other weeks but I think this week we saw all five players contribute um make a difference get us a valuable point and uh keep positive POS feeling around the the club no no young player no no experienced player should take anything for granted because the competition is so high and I think that's what we missed last year we missed that competition for places throughout uh the team at one stage of the season was picking itself that's never healthy so now we have we have that competition it's almost I've got um players competing that are very very level in terms of what they can deliver um and so that's going to push hopefully which we've seen previously with players in other positions to better performances um because the demand to stay in the team is great and you're going to have to be consistent so that's a great thing for for me to have will AAL no there's no guarantee I mean that is a possibility um but uh nothing has decided currently thanks go to Dominic and then Jordan morning Eddie just what's the latest with Callum Wilson after he missed the first two games of the Season yes continuing his um Rehabilitation from injury um yeah me happy with this program he's working very hard as he always does on this this road back um yeah we we miss him I think that's very clear to see because I think he adds a different Dynamic and um will help share the load with other players so he's such an important character as well we miss him when he's not in the squad and around the players so um yeah but fingers crossed we can get him back soon do you expect he'll be back before the international break no no he definitely won't be back before the international break thanks Don Jordan yeah he's doing really well um very pleased with him I think it's always a big step when you come to a club of this size um stature and everything that goes with that it's a a lot for a young player to take on board his first move as well um uh in his career so I think he's handled himself with real class um he's trained very well he's been very level he's been you know very grounded he's focusing on his game and making improvements to his game that he needs to make but he's got the all the qualities that we saw when we signed him he has I'm really looking forward to seeing how his career develops and on Sandro is there a temptation to start him tomorrow and does he need a start sooner rather than later his temptation to to do um anything we want with him um he's done the work I feel confident if we were to start him he would be fit enough to play um so I'll have to make that decision thanks we got to Luke and then C I know it's a difficult time of year but sometimes I do need to push you for a straight answer if you had to choose one of blur and Oasis which one would it be I like your serious tone leading up up to that question um really enjoyed that uh are you serious yeah i' yeah I'd two answers two two two bits to this I think back then it would have been blur but I think now would be Oasis good answer very good isn't it on on to onto transfers did you imagine at the start of the window you would get to this stage um and still be looking to do business or so much business did I expect to get to this stage could you even have imagined it really um it's gone very very late isn't it I think people are a bit Twitchy that there hasn't been the arrivals that people imagined coming in uh I think from my side I think when you go into the window you you sort of have an idea of not not necessarily what's going to happen but you know the parameters you're working in so I think there was every chance this was going to be a difficult one for us um difficult to navigate because because of so many different reasons so now I'm not totally surprised I think the want when you're in my shoes is always to have the squad together as early as possible so you can mold the squad and you can get used to uh personalities that are coming in and you can I have that settled feeling around the squad I think that there's challenges when you bring players in late because it just brings uncertainty and a lack of clarity but we're working through that and we got a few days left um I'm hopeful but there's no guarantees so not confident but hopeful yeah hopeful hopeful thank you thanks L career C and George cin morning Ed a continuation of Luke's theme in terms of putting you on the spot uh Center back or a right winger yeah I can understand I can understand the questions but um for me there's always a level of respect that needs to be shown to your existing members in your squad and I respect every player that we have in every position and I would never disrespect the players so that that's not for me to answer we're trying to strengthen the group we're trying to make the right decisions um and bring the right players in and just on Sandro do you believe he's a better player than the one we last Saw before the ban and if so why uh I'm not sure I think that's that has to be proved I you can make bold statements I want Sandra to come back and first enjoy his football um actually probably first in his everything around his life be settled and in controlled um of that situation and then enjoy his career and enjoy his football and I think if you get a happy player you get a much better player so I've seen enough of Sandro all these months that um I really do back his ability I still love the player um just hopeful that he can um come in in a in a calm way and just add to the team in in his way and is does he have a debt to to you the football club in many ways because of the way you've supported him because of the way you've handled the situation I don't know if de's the right word I I think Sandra will naturally feel that he wants to repay um everyone at Newcastle for the trust that we showed it in when we signed him and I think naturally whenever you go to a new club there's always that want to um show everyone your qualities and give to the team and give to his teammates I'm sure all those things are there for him um we've just handled the situation as we think best and tried to support the human rather than looking at as a footballer first and foremost um and that's what we do to anyone in this situation thank you thanks Craig George you've said more than once that this has been your toughest or most difficult kind of window so far can it still be a good window yeah it can of course um it only takes one one player to make the window um a success or or failure however people view it so we hope certainly with a few days to go as I said we can do something um and if we can then um I always think these things need time you can never make I've seen so many times people go we've had the best window ever and then a year later the team hasn't been successful so time is always the best Judgment of that and sometimes not signing a player is or the wrong player is just as successful um so hopefully I'll make sense um let's see what happens and in terms of that difficulty it's not just about bringing players in it's it's it feels like this has possibly been the first sort of unsettling window for the players you already have is that is that fair comment I think that's fair comment I think that is probably something that may well um exist here um for the foreseeable future because the more successful you are and the better the players do of course they're they're wanted by other clubs and I think that's that's part and parcel of every club's existence and you almost want that problem because that means your players are you know performing at a very very high level so it comes with the territory and um yeah so as I say it's almost two-sided that one okay got to Mark Douglas at the back then across to Louis Taylor um Eddie we kind of forget that the time when um Sandra went out the team there was a little bit of debate about whether he could play with Bruno um has his sort of ABS shown you maybe that that that wasit of a false debate that they can't play together and that you've got a role in mind for him that will come in and SL in SE yeah I think there's real competition for places in that area now which we didn't have last year and I think that's where his absence was really really felt uh during our injury Troubles of last year where we had three sometimes two FIT Center midfielders I think currently we have a bit of a luxury in terms of numbers um with only Louis Miley missing through injury which um will give us really good competition for places which as I said earlier is what we need um I think Sandro's uh game can play uh different roles within our Midfield depend depending on what our tactical structure looks like that versatility is important for us for me you can certainly play with Bruno um there's no there's no Midfield players that we have that can't play with each other I think I'd like to think that's that doesn't exist that that problem but of course we have to prove that on the pitch and and Sandy has to prove that when he comes back and and play as well as he can in terms of his character you've obviously seen the kind of person when he's into some of his lowest moments do you sort of believe that he's a he's a character who's um you know had something his group because you obviously seen yeah I mean he's a he's a very strong guy um he's handled this situation as I've said many times so well um he's shown real strength dignity Integrity um he's been really strong because he's he's been isolated at times it hasn't all um been easy for him he's to really uh I'm sure he's had some really low moments and some lonely moments where the team are playing and sometimes we've when we're having two away games we're we're not been at the training ground for say five six days he's had to train on his own in isolation um and keep his focus and keep his um Spirits high in all those um testing times for him uh so I think we'll get a different player back I think we'll get a stronger player mentally I think we'll get um someone who enjoy his football and probably appreciate every moment because it's been taken away from him for a long period of time so hopefully we'll get the benefits of all of that is there any way that you managed to keep him part of the group when maybe physically hasn't been able to be part of the group if you just sort of is there anything that you've done well we always have different things that we're trying and and we try to make the the injured players and suspended players still part of the team um so I hope Sandra would have felt that team spirit uh still in existence thanks Mark Louise Taylor hi Eddie um now I believe that um Sandro has to make 16 trips to Italy in the next um eight months as part of his suspended ban how awkward logistically is that going to be for you and do you have a say as to when he goes or could he conceivably Miss midweek games yeah I don't envisage him missing games um because of that I think um yeah so I imagine it will be around as it has been previously around training at a time that suits him so no problems regarding that and it's really important that he does go back and how important is he to the evolution of the of the team and its playing style so if you move on eventually from the sort of hard High Press total intensity is can he offer you a gateway to play in a in a different style I think every player naturally adjusts our style slightly to their own to their own game but it's important is around the team team framework I think I don't think there'd be much change in terms of our off the- ball game plan Sandra has to fit into that and he does and he has the ability to do it on the ball he bring his qualities he bring his composure and his ability to play um the way that he does and that would be something that naturally fits our style and this final question there's a sort of um in in kind of medical circles there's a kind of demarcation between like a gambling addict and a problem gambl is the latter is a sort of subclinical thing is is he a genuine addict or is he is it more on the problem side of it I'm not going to go there thanks Louise Dominic sha he how important have Sandro's teammates been in helping him through this last year yeah I think your teammates are so important and the environment and the culture is so important for someone in Sandro's position um he's really well liked by his teammates I will say that and I think I've seen him form really strong uh friendships a really good Social Network people that he can rely on and talk to and uh really good role models for him to be around so I'm really pleased to see him develop those friendships over time and um I think that's so important to your future success within a squad I think you've got to feel part of the fabric you've got to feel involved and certainly he looks at home here now and and you asked about right winger or Central half there can you do both this week uh probably probably not now okay got Mar hard hi Eddie when when was the first time you spoke to Sandro after he was questioned with the ity squad and at that time if you can remember how worried we for him back then that's that's a difficult one um to sort of go back too from my side to to recall every sort of Step of that but I think it just generally it was a real feeling of firstly just being worried about the person genuinely because when you see the media headlines and you know the players facing this moment that that that is not easy for for any person so it was really just to just to help him and protect him and of course we knew the consequences for for us but that was secondary to to him himself and have you two been on a journey together through this 10 10 month period I think uh not necessarily together I think Sandra's been through it with all of us I don't think it's just me it's the St have supported him and he's leaned on different people throughout that time because naturally he's been probably more with the sports science team in certain moments than he has with the as I said with us because we might have been away and playing games and traveling so I think he's leaned on different people throughout that experience definitely isn't just me um the other coaches as I say his teammates have probably been the most important people that would be who he'd be spending the most time with and has it been a learning process for you as a manager and for the club as a whole in how to deal with Sandro's problem yeah well I think education's the key and I think we've tried to um invest time to spread that across the football club whether that's the academy the um first team ladies team you know we do need to spread awareness and uh help everybody uh that might come into um difficulties and sorry last one in terms of that mood 10 months ago what's the contrast like with sand to this week do you see genuine excitement in and can you see that change said many times he's he's not outwardly expressive so it's it's the same I'll no doubt I'll see the same Sandro today he'll be cool calm collected but I'm sure inside he'll be really looking forward to his return and I'm sure he can't wait to wear that shirt again thanks Martin Kieran and then to Simon it's challenging Market as as you've talked about before but do you feel the backing from above to go and get that player you want yeah there's no problem with the the backing and the support never has been it's the uh it's the rules we're trying to abide by and every decision we make has a consequence for the future so we've got to make sure that we're um making wise decisions not leaving ourselves in a vulnerable position again further down the line so that's why these decisions are are complex it's not not as simple as being backed that there's backing there everyone wants the same result um at the football club but it's it's making the the best decisions for the long term Paul Mitch's not at long to sell really coming in during a wind or um how pivotal could he be in helping you guys with his negotiation experience in the final days of the win sorry I missed the name there I'm sorry Paul Mitchell he's come in during a window not at long to settle in how important role will he have in the final days with his negotiating experience absolutely yeah I mean as I said I'm not I'm not doing the deals you know as I said my my role sort of stops on the the choosing of the players and deciding which Avenue to go um Paul and the Paul again doesn't work in isolation he works with a team of people and um you know we're all one team uh working in the for the same outcome um and I'm building a really good relationship with Paul I've been really happy with um how things have been progressing and um yeah so it's not on any one person and we're trying to get the the right end result for the club thanks kieren Simon bird hi Eddie um just another one on Sandro um his agent said he had a gambling illness how do you stop it happening again specifically with Sandro and is there anyone asking him regularly If he if he's bet and if he's over this with it's is such a personal thing with their phones yeah I that's a that's a again a complex question I think I would never go into Sandro's individual um situation because that's his private life and his um situation that he'll continue to work on but yes he's getting the care from the club and he's getting care from the respective people now that's um that will be um a continuous thing for Sandra that will never stop so we have to give him the care and um of course we communication is absolutely vital in this respect and of course now his football career resumes hopefully that is a a stimulus in itself to um to help him really focus on that do yeah that is a very difficult subject really and it's not it's not clear it's not something that you can necessarily um add in that is absolutely covers everything the club are of course aware and will do everything in their powers to try and U make sure we don't end up um signing players that may potentially have this issue but there's no guarantee um and I don't think there's anything really legally you can do um but I know the club are aware of it thank you everyone cheers thank you
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,b0ldAKUfGMk,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0ldAKUfGMk,good morning Eddie um big game to look ahead to but firstly I want to ask you about Kieran trippier because there's been quite a bit in the media about trippier's future over the last couple of days um from your point of view what is the situation with him yeah the situation is business as usual trips has trained really well this week um I'm surprised that a lot of the uh stories that have come out uh a valuable member of the squad is professionalism has been first class um he trained really well since he's come back from the Euros I think he's only had two weeks training hence the decision to not starting at the weekend and also Tino's had a very good preseason um and yeah that's the situation he continues to be really valued by all of us so has he expressed a a willingness to leave or a desire to stay no but neither he hasn't had to so he's just trained as normal um and he's been as I said very good so yeah I'm not really sure where this this has come from but um yeah he's preparing as we all are for the game on Saturday and you'll be happy then but like Miguel Almer on when you talked about him last week if when the window closes next Friday night he is still a Newcastle player yeah of course I mean I think you want from my perspective you want as many players as fit and as available to select from you want as Quality Group as you can and Kieran certainly fits into that he um had an outstanding first season with us last year slightly disrupted by injury at the the end of the campaign but his leadership skills his um ability with the ball his assist record everything that he brings to the group we definitely want here at this point how closer are you do you feel to a transfer happening in or out no there's no news and I'm yeah I am a step removed from it that so it's always difficult for me to give you definitive answers but um I'm aware that there's still work going on behind the scenes but training and preparing for Bournemouth has been as normal um and I'm not getting regular updates so what will be will be onto the football and I think this will be the third time that you've taken Newcastle back to your old Club Bournemouth um I wonder how it has changed for you as an experience going there because there may be less focus and less attention on you now going back there than there was perhaps the first time you went uh yeah I mean I think of course it's it's um a fixture that means a lot to us um as staff because of our length of time with the football club but I think it's never been any different when you turn up for a game you're there to win and you're there to give your best and uh try and do everything you can to get an all important three points for for us currently and and that will never change that never has changed I think hopefully the focus is on the game it should be on the players that we have and their players and competing against each other for what is in a really important stage of the season because we we have to try and start well we have to get momentum in our season and we're thinking of nothing else but that really and they lost Dominic salanki earlier this summer um but they started the season with a a point a late draw against Nottingham Forest what have you made of that match and how they played well I think just going back to last season I think we had two really tough games against them I think they're a very good team I think they've got outstanding attributes within their team very quick athletic side um will hurt you on transitions if you're not set up well you're not organized properly or you're loose with the ball um so I think that athleticism has served them really well very aggressive High pressing team you can see from the stats they're right up there with the best teams in the Premier League in that respect so um we're not fooled by um how difficult this game can be and especially at um at the Vitality stadium so we need to be better than we were on the road last year this is a a challenge this is our first challenge in trying to hit that Target for us so we're looking forward to uh the game of the weekend last one uh on Lloyd Kelly who I'm sure will be really eager to play especially after coming on for his debut last weekend didn't have a lot of football in pre-season what sort of condition is he in and is he ready to start if you need him to yeah I think he's in good condition I think he didn't have a lot of match action in preseason which is always difficult I think he trained um for I think roughly around three weeks towards the end of of preseason and trained really well and I think he's made a a really positive impact with the group I've been really impressed with his performances I thought he did really well when he came on at the weekend in a difficult situation for us I thought he defended really well so I think he would say he's ready and certainly um he's pushing for a starting place thank you Mark benstead Sky Sports Eddie could you talk to us a bit more about what kieran's impact here it felt like his arrival was sort of part of a a catalyst for changing forward and moving forward and kind of what he's done here in his time you mentioned some of his qualities but elaborate bit more on the role he's played well I think he's played a a huge role in changing the the sort of the narrative around uh the team because when he first came in we were in a really difficult position and I think it's very easy to forget that and he took a big risk because he's he's left a a huge football club and he was having a successful period with them to come to a team battling relegation in the Premier League and he he did it through um a real hunger to get back into the Premier League our relationship with him as well I think was pivotal and I think he really galvanized the squad from the first day he um made a speech to the players and I just felt that the whole group's mindset shifted with his leadership skills and his qualities and as I say his performances on the pitch also spoke volumes and he got injured initially but then when he came back into the team I think that that back four that played in the season that we qualified for the Champions League were very consistent we were watertight defensively and that helped Propel us to that position how was your relationship with him developed in that time and how is it now how would you describe it I think like like a lot of my players I'd like to think we're we're close um in the respect that I think think he I'd love to think I can't speak for him but he he feels we're there with his best interests at heart we're trying to develop an improve his game regardless of age and at what stage anyone's career is at we'll always try and push them to improve um yeah I think beyond that there's always a line with manager player relationship that has to be um but I think as long as he sees the respect from me to him and and vice versa then hopefully our relationship will continue to thrive what were you weighing up when you made the decisions regarding the captaincy I think A lot's been made of the captaincy it's it's not that big a deal I think internally because I think um obviously Jamal is not going to be fit for a long period of time so he's been promoted to Club Captain so he's going to oversee the captaincy as an incredible leader behind the scenes um and Kieran and Dan and the leadership group continue to lead as they were last season and they LED really well when someone was down or injured someone else stepped in um and Bruno's been promoted so I think it's I think it's a healthy group there's more people in it um and we want to promote that side you know ultimately the players are on the pitch and they have to lead uh and make decisions on the pitch which are vital in order for us to get results and just finally in terms of transfers you said you sort of slightly removed from things at what stage do you sort of get less removed and ask more questions given that the the clock is sort of ticking down I don't think it quite works like that of course I'm involved in the the selection of the players and that is a a painstaking process it's in-depth a lot of time is spent trying to identify the right targets and then of course when it comes to the negotiations and the deals um naturally that's not my uh not my place thanks Mark Andy uh I was speaking to Sal Adam Armstrong last week and he described Newcastle as animals in a nice way I think I just wonder what you kind of take that as a manager to hear an opposing player obviously a Jordy coming to St James's Park and and describing your team in that man um yeah I hope that's a compliment um I think I think that's a really good thing I mean I think it it's the side that we maybe lacked at times last year the the devilment in our game the ability to be Resolute in tough situations I think we need that back in our game we certainly had it in the um the season before where we were regularly criticized by our opponents but that's because you're doing something right that's because you're finding a way to get under their skin and um to win games maybe that you weren't the most dominant team in we didn't do it enough we need to get it back um so hopefully it's a good start you mentioned that the captaincy there Bruno's obviously very very delighted he spoke after the game last week about how delighted he was what was he like when you had that kind of initial conversation with him about it how did how did he react to the initial conversation well as I said it was it's it's been lowkey there's been no Grand announcement internally it's just Bruno stepped up everyone else's roles has remain the same so it's lowkey I think we've keep saying the same thing but we need 11 leaders on the pitch regardless of who wears the armband uh you need good people um trying to drive the team to success I know he wrote in the program Nots last week about how he wants his his photo up at St james' park with the likes of s Bobby Kevin Keegan Jackie Milburn Etc what's that kind of like to hear as a manager but also do you think that sort of ambition is achievable for a player like Bruno giman yeah I think you have to um you have to have that that drive in you so those players he mentioned are absolute icons of this football club and rightly so um but the ambition has to be for our current players to to join them and to try and put their names up alongside them I think that's a really healthy driver um and Bruner has the capab abilities to be that that kind of player that um player that um lifts his team to Great Heights and that's what we want so um I was really pleased to hear Bruno say those things just looking ahead to Sunday obviously Fabby will be missing with suspension how else are you looking in terms of injuries I think as we were in the buildup to the game I don't think there's been much change Matt target has had now had a little bit more training under his uh under his belt because coming into that game it had only had one or two days and of course he had 45 minutes the week so that was good for him um but apart from that I think we're pretty pretty similar just finally you touched upon it there you touched upon it last week in the press conference about the a away form last season about changing the form on the road what's the biggest thing to change in order to turn that away form around this season do you think I think uh I think the goal's conceded and as I said that's what really pleased me last week because that was a big a big tick in the Box against 11 V10 for a long per per of time in the game um of course we had to withstand pressure but we defended our goal really well we were blocking shots we were throwing our bodies on the line although it was a great return to that style of how we defend um but it's only one game and we have to do that consistency consistently sorry and these types of games um away games any away game in the Premier League is very difficult so uh this is going to be another really good examination of us cheers Eddie thanks Andy Nisha morning Eddie you've talked about out there about the manner of the win last week is there something to be said about getting that type of win as opposed to a three or 40 kind of almost walk Walking the park when you go into this really tough away game yeah I think it's all about finding different ways to win it will never be the perfect game um it will never be well I say it will never always be the perfect game so there'll be games where for whatever reason the team doesn't quite gel with the ball there'll be team there be times when physically we're looking tired or feeling tired in the game that that's just natural through a 38 uh Game season so it's when you're in those moments or we have a disappointment like this the sending off can we regroup and can we still find a way to win the game and we did through great credit to everybody um it was a brilliant response it was an important game the first one always is it sets the marker down for what we want to be um but we have to find the consistency in that there's no good delivering that one game and then not backing it up so that's why this week's a big a big opportunity for us and it's a big week as well because you have three games in in the space of a week how are you managing that and do you are you happy with the numbers that you've got at the moment in the depth for that yeah I think so I think maybe at some stage early stage during preseason it wasn't looking that um that promising for us in terms of bodies and getting players back but I think we've done really well through preseason to touch wood keep the majority of our players fit we haven't picked up any fresh injuries and we've gradually starting to get one or two players back which makes such a big difference um as you say to the depth part we're still missing some important players um obviously two of those longer term but I'm confident we can handle this this week coming up um and we want to go into the week in in good spirits we've done that with the first result um against Southampton but now this one takes on extra importance because the cup games as we know they're they're massive for our season and just uh finally um I know you say A lot's been made of the captaincy possibly too much in your opinion I just want in terms of the process is it a decision that you purely take on your own or do you take input from the players as well no I think in these decisions it's it's purely my decision um I don't think you can canvas opinion on things like that um with them I think sometimes as a manager you have to uh back your own decision thank you thanks Tia thanks br reest this uh we will include Sundays as well so if you can hold your questions please do uh we'll start with Daman Spellman Ed just on Fabian share you um before you arrived his his future he looked a bit uncertain but he's become one of your your most Dependable players as as a coach or as coaches how much pride does that give you in bringing out the helping to bring out the quality that he has shown over the last couple of years yeah I think look everyone has qualities um it's about do do they mirror with how you want the team to play um and some cases that's yes and some cases that's no with Fabian it was a case of absolutely yes because he's one of the best users of the ball that I've I've seen in that position um incredible range of passing he can play short long big switches um you name it he can deliver it with the ball at his feet off both feet as well which is really rare um so as I said many times I knew about Fabian before coming here and really liked him so then it was a case of can we get the other areas of his game to a level that that complement the team and he's done the work he's really defended very well he's trained very well um so yeah I was really pleased with where his game's been at since I've been here and now the challenge is always to to push that on okay we'll go to Jordan Lee and then Luke Jordan I just on the Fabian CH red card did you did you end up appealing that in the end yeah we did yeah okay um and then just looking forward as well on back to preseason Jamal Lewis and what's happening with his future um Jamal is still in the same position that I discussed I think a couple of weeks ago um let's see what happens between now and the window there's a chance he could leave um let's wait and see and can I just ask on the goalkeeping situation as well five goalkeepers I think you mentioned preseason that he probably couldn't carry that number could there be any potential outgoings in the coming weeks with that in the next week with that situation possibly thanks Jan Lee um Eddie just looking at the business bouth have done everyone in the past have looked at them as kind of underdogs but would you see them as contenders for a place in Europe this season given what they've done yeah I think I think you have to when you look at their form um last season after the first what was it nine 10 games I think that their form is excellent and they were right up there in terms of being consistent enough to be um European contenders if they'd had a better beginning to the season uh but it's not only that I think when you just look at the everything stats based now and you look at them statistically as a team they've been very strong in in both phases of the game with and without the ball so they've added to the group yes they've lost um salanki who was a huge player for them but I think they've replaced him with an equally outstanding player and they've improved other areas of the team so yeah I think they're European contenders um and I think they're developing nicely as a team and and just on this this week I mean to say it's a pivotal week feels a bit over the top but obviously the cup game away at Premier League opposition it's kind of a crunch crunch moment isn't it because that's a cup you want to do well in yes a pivotal week already um but no we we know that the every week's pivotal um you're entering a cup competition and we want to stay in it so we'll look at that after this game but we've only had one game of the Premier League and you know the early games set as I said earlier set the tempo set the momentum set the energy um so we've got to take this game absolutely seriously and we've got to go into it with the right frame of mind um try and get a positive result and if we can then it would have been a great start for us thanks Lee Luke Ed good to see you haven't taken the England job um while I've been away um Kieran trippier do you think he'll still be here at the Clos the transfer window I hope so yeah I can never say answer these questions with absolute certainty because it's football um and the transfer window is always unpredictable but I I my wish is that he stays here and continues to play for us just one on the share you said you'd appealed it um what came back from the fa on that negative did they give you a reason um I haven't seen the reason I just found out the result the club stillw the reasons from the fa you've requested the reasons well the club's just waiting to hear from the fa on that but but the appeal was rejected thank you Greg op morning Eddie uh if someone above the clo sorry someone someone above you did come to you in the next week or indeed Qing himself and said there had been an offer and the indication was they wanted that to proceed what would your response be I never like dealing with hypotheticals Craig as you'd understand um otherwise we could be here a long long time so we we'll take in every individual case that way uh we try and make the right decision for the player and the football club yeah but but even at 33 34 next month he still is a a huge player for you you know evidence by the fact that he started six of England seven games in the summer there's never any doubting his his qualities as a player he's an outstanding player and we need as many outstanding players as we can here um he's had two weeks training before the first game so I think you saw a lot of the international players that had played in major tournaments left out of their respective teams thank you thanks cck Kieran Kelly morning Eddie it's been a strange Market this summer is there still an element of frustration for you you haven't maybe got that Difference Maker in yet yeah I think if you ask any manager sat in my seat the the aim would always be to improve your squad every window um and whether it's one difference maker or two or three really good players that take your team on you'd always want that um you'd want that as early as possible so you can mold them to your principles and style of play but you have to deal with the market that's in front of you you can't um do anything other than try and get the best out of the group of players that you have and that's what we're trying to do um we are still active in the market we're trying to improve the squad um and we've still got a bit of time yeah we we've seen Newcastle sign Gordon and isach in the final days of the window before you have hope you will get that player you want ultimately yeah there's no guarantee you we'll try we'll try to the last seconds to come out of the window with a better Squad okay we'll finish off with a few more for dies and we'll go to Sundays after that we'll go with Dominic Joe and Martin to finish hi how did Kieran respond to the captaincy decision I don't know how many times I've got to repeat it kieran's role remains exactly the same has this been a drain in transfer window um yeah I think it it's been the most difficult that I've experienced without going overall ground that the June the June part of the transfer window was incredibly difficult um and now this period hasn't been exactly easy either for us so I think um it's always going to be difficult because you competing for a race more pool of players um and the competition is high from other clubs as well so I always think you can judge transfer windows in many different ways let's judge it obviously there's an initial assessment at the end but there's also you have to give it time to um to see how things lie in a year or two years time and what would be a successful last week of the window for you again it's another hypothetical I I don't know I mean of course keeping the the majority of the squad together would be priority number one I always think that's the biggest priority before bringing incomings and then of course trying to sign um players that make a difference thank you thanks Dom Joel hi Eddie um just on l Kelly what can fans expect from him obviously the he's been in Jed a lot in Bournemouth and he hasn't played too much in preseason so what can Nast fans expect from him and then new gastle Shar I think he saw a taste of that last week I think he'll bring a really good defensive mentality to whichever position he plays he's got versatility he can play center half and left back and that's one of the things that we really loved about him real speed you know he is very very quick for a Defender um very athletic in short and big distances and I think since he's come he's used the ball really well too technically I think he's been at a really high level so um I think you can expect to see those things and uh just a couple of out go Ryan Fraser Isa Hayden any movement on those are they expected to leave not as far as I know and uh final one for me just on some of the younger players lawn moves is that something you're you're still looking to do sort of Tron new see maybe Alex Murphy those sort of players yeah we make a decision on all the the younger Lads um internally we've sort of had those discussions let's see if anything comes for them that they um they want to they want to do thank you thanks Joe Martin hi Eddie did you feel it was sorry last one on this I'm sure did you feel it was a big decision to promote Bruno and were you concerned it might impact Kieran at all with the cap issue um I think every decision you makees a you have to think about it and you have to try and get get the uh you know I'm making probably I wouldn't put a number on it but hundreds of decisions a week and you're never going to get them all right you've got to try and get more right than you get wrong I think on the captaincy it was about um empowering Bruno um and everyone's else's role remains exactly the same um changeing attack slightly is this is a big week for Sandra Tali have you had a conversation withm Will He travel to Bournemouth and how much mental strength has he shown in the last 10 months um sorry what was the first part of that question sorry it's a big week for Sandro tardi coming up Will He travel with you to Bournemouth to get him back into the field of the squad um and how much me mental strength has he shown to the last 10 months yeah I don't think he travel with Bournemouth I think he he knows how to travel to games I don't I don't think he needs that experience um yeah I think he's shown real mental strength and I think you'll see a better player from this eventually I think you'll see a much stronger person from it because whenever you go through adversity and tough times I think you do find uh more strength than you realize you had it's been a long wait for him he's handled himself impeccably he's trained really well he's been an excellent teammate for the other Lads um and I think they will definitely rally around him and help him in these early stages um but I'd say he's his training performances have steadily improved and got even better the closer it's got to to his return so I think he's fully focused now on that first game H has he had lows during that time and have you had to look after him has he had what sorry sorry has he had lows during that time lows right okay um I'm sure he has I mean they haven't been evident to me so he's not someone that evidently wears his emotions outwardly I think there's more inward for him um as he would be similar to me in my character um where you know you sort of a lot going on beneath the surface you don't necessarily see it outwardly and I think he's no doubt had lows and difficult moments and difficult times and he's leaned on his the strong um support that he has he has really good people around him which is certainly would have helped him in those difficult moments so last and you're excited about the impact he can make absolutely yeah I'm really looking forward to seeing him play again um for for him and for everybody connected with the club the supporters um I'm sure this will be a big moment in career
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,ZtUJy_OOCMc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtUJy_OOCMc,morning everyone welcome to First Press Conference of the season if you have a question um please remember to use your microphones just one click you get a little red button and make sure you turn it off once you're finished uh we'll start with Matthew as as usual Matthew thanks uh Eddie morning um new season is here how excited are you yeah there's always a great feeling before a new season so much unknown um I think we've had a good preseason Lads have worked really well it's been an intense period as it always is but I think we look fit uh the team's in a good shape especially after the two games last week um so looking forward to the game and how nice is it for you to have the opportunity to kick things off in front of your own supporters at home yeah I mean I think your preference is always for that first game to be at home when you go back two years ago to the Nottingham Forest game that was a big um win for us to set our season off that was a tough game though newly promoted teams there's a lot of similarities between that game and this one we know uh the supporters will be with us um we know how important they are to our season than they were last year the environment of james' Park was incredible um but we have to do our bit in terms of intention and all the little things that make the difference at home we have to repeat from last year and what about your opponents Southampton promoted through the playoffs just a few months ago how do you think they will approach things and and will they be doing anything differently now they're in the Premier League under Russell Martin well I think that remains to be seen I think I think Russell has done a great job um I've always admired the style of play from Swansea to to Southampton I think he's had strong beliefs in how he sees the game very clever tactically very astute um slightly different um and I think all of those things add to a complex game for us that we need to manage correctly we need to uh do our preparation and um deliver a really good performance this will be a difficult game they are um as I say they they're slightly different and we need to be ready for that challenge and know that there's no there's no guarantee in anything you know we have to uh deliver a really strong performance just want to ask you finally about one player um Miguel almeron there's been some reports about his future this week and the possibility of a move to the United States he is still here he's still your play what's been your position on that and on Al maron's situation yeah there's been a lot of speculation though with migy over the summer and I'm sure that would have been very difficult for him I think there was a lot of speculation as he was playing for his country during the summer I think he's a really valued member of the squad um I'm sure that speculation have been difficult for him to to manage but he's very much with us we very much value his qualities and what he brings and I hope he has a great season so you'll be happy if he ends up staying whether there's interest or not if he's still your player when the transfer window closes yeah absolutely and and we'll work with Miggy to try and get his game to the level it was two years ago where he was absolutely incredible for us um his commitment and his attitude and professionalism is is second to none he is a truly brilliant person and a great professional so he is um an important player for us and we don't underestimate his qualities in any way thank you Kei Downey Eddie you were at times last season beset by injuries and I think it was it almost became this the story of of your season there's obviously a few players still missing a hangover from last season but where are you in terms of the overall picture injury-wise going into the the new season do you feel like you're in a better position I think we're definitely in a better position than we were for the majority of last season and certainly to to the back end of last season so we've got Nick Pope back fully fit uh I touch with with all of these because we still got training before before we play um Joe willon a lot better play I wouldn't say he's 100% um match fit he's had two games he's trained well but he's certainly on the road to being the The Joe will that we all know and love uh several other players that I think are in a lot better physical condition than last year we've got um obviously Sandro hopefully um getting closer to returning um but yeah we still have the legacy of the injuries from last year the long-term ones of jamalo Sven botman obviously we lost Callum during the early stages of preseason he's a huge Miss Lou Miley um Matt Target is making his early steps back he's trained this week which has been brilliant and he's trained really well so um we've still got some work to do but we're in a much better place and is there a feeling that if you if you manage to keep the injuries to a minimum and of course I know that is a is a big if and it's hypothetical but is there a feeling if you if you manage to do that and you keep up the majority if your best players available you can have a a real goal this season because your your squad looks looks strong if everyone's available the majority of them are yeah of course I think that was always the plan is to is to keep your best players fit um and I think for us with our style of play being as intense as it is and as demanding it as is it is we can still do that the two things go hand inand I got to say um from the preseason perspective I think it's been managed really well I think we of course we lost Callum but apart from that I think we're in pretty much full bill of health from preseason onwards um but we've got the work into the players but the squad's are generally very healthy um motivated um fitness-wise I think we look we look good I think there's a couple of players that are still a little bit away from their Optimum levels having come back later um but overall I'm happy when do you expect Callum back do you know yet Kum will be the early early early season so couple of games in I think he's making really good progress he's really uh feels good and and wants to push a bit faster but we're just trying to manage his his comeback and and on on Tino liento um I saw him last week in the in the friendlies and he he actually looks like he's changed physically looks like he's sort of filled out a bit L really strong is he in a position now because obviously at times last season he was playing second fiddle to to Kieran but is he in a position now where he's he's ready to be a a regular starter and and he needs to sort of be let let let loose if you like well I think his performances will dictate that not not his feeling you know it will be how he how he performs I think physically he's in a good place he's had um just trying to think the majority of preseason I can't think of any any issues for him really during preseason he had his ankle injury at the back end of last year but uh we really believe in him we really love his qualities and what he brings to the team um but he's got serious competition in Kieran I mean that it's going to be fascinating to see how those two players um compete if we play with a back four for one position got two top talents two amazing characters um so that's going to be a an interesting thing to see and just finally from me you said um last week that in terms of transfers you were looking for Quality rather than than quantity with that does it make it harder to get a deal done I mean I know you won't talk about individual players but we all see the talk about Mart gahi and the protracted move for him but in general is it harder to get a deal done when you're looking for that top level of player that does it does does is that drag it out a bit longer I think everyone's looking for the best players that they can they can find I think from our perspective as you said earlier we've got a good squad um when everyone's fit I think we got a very good squad so to you know sign players uh and make your squad better is difficult but it it's achievable we can do it um but what you don't want to do is make a sign and then in 3 or 4 months time go well it hasn't really kicked us on anywhere and you're just adding numbers that's something we've got to avoid at all costs in my opinion so it's the difference makers the the players that can take the team on is what we're looking for thanks Ed thanks Keith Andy on Eddie good to see you um busy old summer obviously with the trips to Australia Tokyo Etc but you did find time for a bit of acting with JT for the Adidas adverts how did you find it yeah it was good I mean it was it was something slightly different I think taking out our comfort zone to a degree and I think you realize and you have a lot of sympathy for all the actors out there that that work for days on end for probably one scene me and J it felt like a lot of work for a sort of a little two second flash um I thought JT was the star of the show to be honest when I looked back at the advert and when it was all finished I was disappointed with my part um I thought I could have done a lot better but JT was dominating the screen to see been too hard on yourself uh seriously speaking the fans have a few of them have been speaking to kind of described the transfer window and the summer as frustrating with PSR the transfer window I just wondered how you would kind of describe it from a managerial perspective that side of things uh can't swear can I June June was difficult you know June was was stressful yeah June was um very very different I've not been in that situation before where you're you're in a position where you're looking to potentially make decisions from a financial perspective but not from a football perspective and that sort of goes against everything that I'm thinking about is trying to improve the team but but for that moment it was totally different um once that had gone and we sort of got over the disappointment of losing two really talented young players that we didn't want to lose um you look forward and you look to the Future you have to and it's all then been about improving our Squad as much as we can now I think the players that we've recruited so far orbe it not a huge in number or transfer fees I think have have added to the group but we're certainly hoping we can do some more in the next two weeks how many times has anyone mentioned silverware to you in this pre-season and ahead of this new season and what will you want to be talking about come May 2025 would you think as far as that is aw yeah I think of course that that's the that's the ultimate goal is to lift a trophy or trophies on a consistent basis that has to be newcastle's aim from now onwards uh and of course I share that vision and I'm encouraging that Vision but I think if you're focusing purely on the outcome of the trophy you're losing sight of what you need to do we have to improve everything we're doing we have to be smart in the transfer market we have to improve our training we have to to improve every aspect of the football club to try and get there so I'm sort of very much in the middle of the process and I'm not thinking about the end result but that's always on my mind it's great to hear as well just the other day the definitive return date for Sandro tanali have you spoken with him since that news has kind of been released and just how excited is he to be back and playing competitively again because it has been so long he's a very cool customer Sandro he's he's not outward emotional necessarily so dayto day you don't um you don't sort of see that I'm back you know a big a big grin on his face but he's very um contained emotionally he's very strong I think he's handled himself so well during this period he really has I mean when you consider how difficult it's been for him I'm sure he's had some really hard days but there's the pressure of the media there's dealing with everything that's gone with his situation he's trained really well he's been a great teammate I think the players will only speak highly of how he's conducted himself and they see the true Sandro sort of sometimes more than we do in the dressing room um but I know how focused he is on his return and I know how excited he isn't to come back and to show to everyone to Newcastle and to thank everyone from newcastle's perspective how they've treated him how they've handled him especially his relationship with the supporters which is incredible to see from my perspective again another huge thing for me to say thank you to the Newcastle supporters to how they've looked after him for how they've um dealt with him socially I think it's been incredible response and that will only help him when he returns yeah be great to see him back ju just finally from me um on a completely different note I don't know if you saw the story of Mel arteta employing a team of pickpockets to keep his team alert it was described ahead of the new season how are you keeping your players alert before the new season and heading into this game against Southampton I can't imagine you've employed a team of pickpockets but well may I say what a great link to the question thank you that was impressive um get the good questions out way at the start of the you used them up I don't have anything to give you that's even relatable to that but yeah I've not seen the story so um I'd probably need to dig into that a little bit more cheers Eddie best luck tomorrow no worries thanks Andy Nisha morning Eddie and Alexander isach is a player that will be huge for you this season do you think he could be the Premier League's top scorer come May well he could be yeah of course he's got the talent and the ability to be I think he's had a good preseason um but he's going to be competing against all the elite Strikers that are in the Premier League um I think it's our job to supply him you know as as the team to try and give him as many chances as possible as our um as our Center forward in the team at the moment um but also there's an expectation on him to do all the stuff that won't get talked about so so regularly here in terms of leading our line and um starting our our out of possession game plan delivering that to the highest level he can set plays Etc all the stuff that probably's not seen is so important from a Striker's perspective now in the modern day um but we do need him to contribute of course his his assists his his creative play and of course his goals which is fundamentally so important to us what do you make of um the V changes coming in supposedly higher threshold for intervention quicker are you feeling quite confident about that coming in well I think year on year you'd love to think that that the whole process will improve um I think speed's important to everybody connected with football because it is a high-intensity game we want it to be a quick game so I welcome that I I do welcome and I've always said more responsibility for the referees in game decision making they they're sensing the game they're feeling the emotion of the game they're very much reacting to um uh the moment that that they're in and I think that needs to be respected so a higher threshold for for their decisions I back as well um but of course we just want to see a better product and we want to see more consistently right calls um and hopefully this will help and just finally um you've spoken about injuries but I just wanted to double check about Fabian show because he seemed to get injured last weekend yeah well hopeful Fabian Fabian will be okay um he felt the effects of the tackle early in the week but fingers crossed he'd be fine thank you thanks Nisha damus Felman hi Eddie just going some back to something you mentioned earlier you've been in football a long time worked through some difficult periods you know working for a club with potentially enormous spending power but you're having to take Financial over football decisions how difficult is that as a manager I think I had a really good grounding um during my early years at Bournemouth it was transfer embargos couldn't sign players for a year um players not getting paid on a regular basis BFF's coming into the football club on a regular basis daily so I think got a really good grounding in terms of the finances and how delicate they can be for any football club um the situation of course here is totally different to that here it's we're restricted in our spending because of financial fair play rules which we have to respect we have to adhere to um I think the only thing from my perspective and I've said this before is I got no no issue dealing and working with the restrictions that we're under but the expectations then have to be adjusted to what we're the reality of the world we're living in and I think sometimes there's a there's a misalignment there's constantly talking about the richest club in the world and we got all this money um but we're not allowed to spend it so expectations have to be adjusted in my opinion and just on that front there were reports this morning that fourth bid has gone in for Mar I know you you don't want to talk about individuals is there anything close at all on any front not that I know of no thank you thank D Lee Ryder hi Eddie just going back to a couple of years ago when you got into the Champions League great achievement do you think looking at this season it's going to be even harder now see West Ham has spent a lot of money there's a couple of other teams that could throw in there as well but is even more competitive than it was two years ago yeah I think the Premier League does I think it it year on year gets more competitive you see more and more teams now that um are spending money but spending money doesn't guarantee anything but they're spending money wisely in my opinion making some great signings so I think that just makes everybody um better and it it it Bridges the Gap but I think from a from probably a neutral perspective that's that's great I think the Premier League being a tight league and never quite knowing what's going to happen next makes for the product that we have of course from our perspective we have to maximize every ounce of ability energy um Quality from the group that we have that that's my job um I think we've got a really tight group you know we've got we haven't got excess players we've got a a small Squad um but a squad when everyone's fit of high quality and my job is to try and get every outset of those players and just on Kieran trippier whether he plays or he doesn't we've seen it at the Euros when he he didn't play in the final he was in the tunnel go around Gan everybody up and stuff like that how much do you value that type of character behind the scenes yeah I think so important that your experienced players are good leaders and they're good people that's fundamentally important to the group because if your experienced players aren't those people then you have issues you you'll have a a difficult changeing room to manage so the experienced players have a duty of care towards the football club to act in the right way to look after the younger players and to set the right role model and the right intent every day of how we're going to work and and what our attitude is to to our jobs kieran's the epitome of that he's an incredible person a great leader and um yeah we're delighted that he's with us and just finally on competition for places I guess you're never going to complain about that it's better than the team picking itself yeah I think I've been through every in my career as as a manager I've been through every situation when you've had loads of players to pick from no players to pick from and certainly the the better one is having more players than than none because that competition is what drives players on there's no other way for them to think if they want to get in the team they have to show they're better than the guy they're competing with thanks Lee Jordan hi Eddie when when you asked about transfers you don't tend to give a lot away now this week obviously the mar deal has been play and the more gay deal has been played out in public does that disappoint you or frustrate you at all no not at all I think I can only control myself and what I say and I try to do that as well as I can um but you're not in control of every aspect of the deal in other clubs and sometimes even your own club and that's and that's fine because there's loads of different ways to to work I I I don't comment on transfer speculation more out of respect for the other club and for the other players involved because if you comment on one then you have to comment on everybody so I don't want to go down that road I try to be very respectful knowing that that's how i' would want to be treated the other way when our players are getting linked with other football clubs so that's why I do what I do I think was in to you mentioned that you hope to get at least one Play Over the Line before the transfer window close is that still the case hopeful yeah we're working hard there's sort of no lack of effort from our side um but uh as I said earlier there's nothing close thanks Jordan we've got Dominic and then Chris hi Eddie you spoke about managing Squad numbers and incoming is obviously really important to that but obviously outo is just as pressing in the final two weeks of the window I wouldn't say as pressing I think we as I said earlier we've got a tight Squad so we don't have excess players I'm making I'm naming a squad tomorrow and that's probably every every player that's fit would be in it I don't think we're going to have anyone spare so that's how that's how tight we are at the moment in terms of terms of that of course we've got a few few injuries as well that are still in the mix as I spoke about earlier so I'm certainly not pushing to to lose anybody and you touch on Sandro tali's return it's now potentially less than two weeks away given how long he's been out will he be in a position to to start games or will you have to ease him in almost I think he'd be in a position to start games it's whether physically he's very fit he's he's in a really good place he just hasn't had the the matches and the game sharpness that you can only get from from the games very difficult for us to stimulate him in that way we have put games on we have had training games but they're not the same they're not Premier League games they're not in front of a crowd they're not everything that you get the all the emotions you go through before you play it's not the same so I think it'd be fit I think he'd be ready to play will he be in his absolute best condition probably not for a month or so I'd say thanks Dominic Chris WF morning Eddie uh at the end of last season heading into the window you sort of talked about hopefully evolving the squad and the team by this stage going into the first game of the season did you expect to be further ahead with that did you expect to have further signings who would materially improve the first 11 yeah I mean I think we have evolved the squad but is it's not necessarily always in terms of personnel um of course yes we've had a couple of incomings but it's more can we take the team on tactically can we take the team on with how we're playing we're trying to do that all the time we're trying to add layers to our game we're trying to improve have we done that I think we have during preseason um obviously the proof will be in what we deliver um going into the season but I think the players that we have here and the squad we have is in a good place and ready to play and if you ended the window without uh another signing coming in would you be content with the squad that you have or are you determined to bring in further players well determined to to try and improve the squad but at the same time if we can't for whatever reason then yeah of course I'd go forward with the squad with pride um backing every single player that we have internally to to do the job we need Scott Wilson I you um you just said there that you you're not really pushing to lose anyone um but the club you know there has been times in the past where we said that that player trading is is very important when you talk about the football and financial kind of balance if anyone was to leave before the end of the window would that now be a purely footballing decision or is there still Financial pressures to do outgoings before the end of the month there's there's not necessarily Financial pressures to lose anybody before the end of this window but player trading as I've said is key we have to trade players out as well as players in um but that's not necessarily in the next two weeks but certainly within the next um window um that's what we'll have to do and and the um the players that came back later you said not necessarily quite at 100% but are they ready to start are they you know are you are you happy enough that that they're near enough to be able to do themselves Justice tomorrow yeah I'd say they're all all of those players that came back later are physically fit they are ready to play they proved that in the preseason games are they absolutely 100% at their maximum level probably not but I think you know they're very close to it thank you Kieran Kelly morning Eddie um OB SE Newcastle been very persistent in the past and the transfer wind with top targets Gordon livero isach um is there an element of holding your nerves staying calm you know outside we look at it there's only maybe two weeks left do do you have to stay calm to get that right player maybe this summer yeah I think there's there's two ways to look at that that yes if you believe in the deal and you believe in the player and it's still within your financial structure then yes 100% but then there are times when you have to go now you know what that's too much and we've done that plenty of times in the last two and a half years and sometimes you wouldn't find out about that um where you you'll have to switch Target so I'm sort of giving you an answer of both really because it depends on the deal and it depends on on what money you have spend of that time and like the season before last maybe there have been pundits who maybe feel Newcastle won't finish in the top four won't fish in top six can you relish being a dark horse does that give you any fuel I don't are we a dark horse I don't know I suppose uh if you look at other teams have spent more money that's how some people judge you know if they have to preview the season right now um that maybe you go on the radar a little bit yeah I wasn't trying to be clever I don't actually know what people are saying about so um I I don't know I I think from our perspective I'd probably prefer to be that and and related to the answer I gave earlier that you know when you look at the sums invested this summer we're way we're way off what some clubs have invested but that doesn't guarantee anything but it does maybe change the expectations at that football club so I think as I said we continually get called the richest club in the world we haven't been able to spend that money so we are where we are I love the squad that we have um and I probably prefer to come from that dark horse that not fancied written off we'll take that if that's the narrative and we'll try and prove people wrong that's what we've always done here thanks K Lise Taylor and then Simon bird Louise hi Eddie hi um how how are your relationships evolving with James bunts and and Paul Mitchell and are the boundaries set to um your satisfaction it's been good yeah I mean I think I think James speaking individually has come in and done a really good job he's very Hands-On very involved in what we're doing dayto day been hugely impressed by his work and how he's adapted to us and how we've adapted to him there's always that you're trying to build a new relationship very quickly um hugely impressed same with Paul Paul's gone about his work I don't have the day-to-day necessarily contact with Paul that I do with James he's obviously got a big job to do he sometimes um traveling he's sometimes here um but we're building I think a really strong relationship again I've been very impressed by his work and wealth of experience managed and not managed worked at some huge clubs um he's done a his CV and his track record is incredible so yeah I think we're in a in a good place I've been enjoying the relationships so your initial anxieties have been which were understandable have been allayed I think uh as you as you quite rightly asked in terms of the boundaries and the relationships yes we're in that early stages where we're adjusting to each other and forming those relationships and so far it's all positive thank you thanks Lise Simon hi Eddie um you've not got a marquee signing yet and many of your Rivals have have spent heavily and have uh but yet there's an expectation for you to deliver top four top six again um is a club still keeping you happy in reference to your Germany comment yeah I I don't know if it's the job's the club's job to keep me happy I don't look at it that way it's about I'm certainly not sat there're going I've demand this and I demand that I'm not that kind of guy I want to push the team forward I want us to have the best chance of being successful I want to try and reward everybody connect to a Newcastle that's given me and the club so much so I am pushing to to try and deliver that but I also have to understand where the club's at and there's some things you just cannot do so you have to accept you you can't react any other way than go okay what can we do not worry about what we can't do and that's always been very much my mindset as well let's deal with the the facts and let's try and push the team forward in any way that we can yeah um it sounds like um Palace Crystal Palace have a big decision to make today the reports are the clubs got very close to the um the price for a player who we shouldn't talk about um could could you walk away from a deal if if it's too much is that is that how the club's got to work I mean there's players you want but if they ask in prices too much you could you could you could walk away yeah I've said I think I said that earlier that we we have done many times in my time here where especially early on where there was a very much a a Newcastle tax on any deal where we would rung up the the price would double so many times we were that's not for us we're not going to go down that road where we're over what we feel we're overpaying for players um I think that's changed slightly cuz people have seen the dynamic that we're not going to pay silly fees for players so I think now it's returned more to normality Martin Hardy morning Eddie um what does a successful season look like this year uh what does successful season look like I think it looks when I look at the team and I'm seeing a growth in the team um from last year last year we had difficult spells the attitude of the group was always very good we came back for some really difficult moments with real strength finished the season strongly so I want to I want to see the team evolve and improve I want to see us scoring in the way that we were last year I thought our attacking play was Second To None we really want to try and improve that in any way that we can um but certainly defensively we got that's the big area for us from last year we've got to improve we've got to look to make big gains in that area and I think if we can added to our attacking play I think that should serve us well and here's one of the key things trying to temper expect ations a little bit kind of you went up like a rocket in SE your first full season but obviously there's financial difficulties now that you're trying to deal with is is there a commment of what can be achieved it's a difficult one for me to say that because I don't want to dampen people's enthusiasm or aims dreams I don't want to go down that road where I'm seen as a negative and I'm trying to kill things absolutely not I want the Newcastle supporters to turn up on Saturday believing that we are capable of greatness and great things and long-term success so no part of me trying to kill that but I think just backing the players from minute one till the end of the game that that's all I've ever asked for trying to create an environment that the opposing team comes and does not relish and does not want to play in after the game I can deal with the the stuff that goes with that if we're not successful um but just back the players during the game and is there an importance the likes of Kieran Callum and Miguel alaron who've been linked away is there an importance that they're here and they they're uh really significant part of your squad well they're huge players for us and they're all really talented players so there's been I think I said this in a press conference a week ago maybe two weeks ago that near enough every player in the squad's been linked away this this summer um so we have to collectively I think put our arms around the whole Squad and show them how much we love them myself the supporters that relationship between player and supporters is so so important because we have to see the best of these players in order for us to be successful so I think it's a real coming together I think hopefully starting on Saturday that we we all show our love for each other cheers Thanks Martin Gary morning Eddie um you mentioned there about how important it is to start at hope there were seven matches last year at s James is where he dropped points how important is it to improve that make S uh St James is you know that Fortress again to help you get back yeah I mean I think just an answer to that I think if we could guarantee our home form from last year going into this will be pretty similar i' take that now as the away form that we needed to improve I think our home form was really strong um I think there was a a great feeling around the stadium there was very few games where I'd walk away disappointed with our performance at St james' Park so I think that doesn't mean that that's going to be the same this year and teams will make it more difficult for us they'll have different plans certainly be we're certainly aware of of what we need to do so I think the away form is a big Improvement area the home form is c can we improve it can we go better um we were free scoring at home think we entertained the supporters of course there's areas to improve but um it's it's all linked to the feeling I think and um hopefully we can set a good tone on Saturday and this is obviously your last chance to speak to a part as before tomorrow what would just be your final message to them ahead of kickoff yes is similar to what I just said really I think supporting the players from minute one to the end as they always have done since I've been here I think they've been magnificent I look back to games last year one of the key games was West Ham at home 3-1 down and the supporters were still cheering and singing for the players they were the atmosphere was still very very positive we came back in 43 and that was that was down to them so it's those kind of moments where we need them more than ever um and just be very grateful if they could repeat that again for us
Newcastle,Eddie Howe,Press Conferences,LCXd209XytY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCXd209XytY,hi Jason good morning Uh last night the club announced that Eddie How had been diagnosed with pneumonia and was still recovering away from the club Um I'm sure you'll want to wish him all the best but can you firstly tell us how he's doing uh that's the only update really We've uh had minimal sort of dialogue together since uh since that announcement So you know as we know he's in the best possible hands uh and he'll be back as soon as he feels he's ready to come back and 100% to lead the team Obviously his health has to come first How much does this put into perspective everything football and health and what's important of course as we know your health is the most important thing Uh and that's why it's so important that you know when Eddie does decide to come back he comes back and he's able to lead the team as we know he does day in day out and you know he's he's fully recovered and and I'm sure he will do uh and as I said he's in the best possible hands right now Obviously you led the team along with Graeme Jones and the rest of the backroom staff on Sunday against Manchester United and we know you'll do the next couple of matches You said there that you'd had minimal contact with Eddie how what sort of role if any will he play in helping prepare the team for the matches in the the weeks ahead as we know I think you know for the manager not to be here is is obviously poorly in hospital and uh the same is last week we had sort of almost minimal contact in terms of within the preparations but you know we know the expectations and demands that we put on each other and ourselves each and every day Uh and it's going to have to remain that way until the manager is back But we know what we need to do We know we know how we prepare uh and we need to prepare right to make sure that we can go and deliver performances as I said the weekend that the manager will be proud of And you personally how do you feel about continuing to lead while Eddie How is away from the club recovering obviously it's part of my job Uh and you know I'll do the best I possibly can in in his absence So we've you know we've worked together for 17 years now so we know what is expected of each other uh and hopefully I can deliver the same messages as is what he would want Uh and you know hopefully he'll be back as soon as possible Looking back at Sunday how proud were you of everybody the way that the players performed for you but also I suppose the manager as well in delivering such a a brilliant display and a massive result Obviously really proud Uh and the most important thing was that the players went out there and delivered a performance that the manager would be proud of and would expect Uh testament to the group of players and staff that we've got here at the football club Uh showed a fantastic attitude Everyone pulled together at a time like this when they needed to Uh hence they went out and delivered the performance that they did against Manchester United And what sort of opportunity lies ahead for you with this game in hand against Crystal Palace they're a team that's been in good form recently They've got a cup semi-final They were two up at Manchester City at the weekend So I'm sure you're expecting a tough game but you know if you avoid defeat you'll go up to third Yeah we're not thinking about uh anything other than our preparations for for tomorrow night's game and to go out there and deliver a performance that we know we need to deliver to be good enough to win the game Crystal Palace have been in fantastic form I think Saturday was only their second defeat on the road in 15 Uh they don't concede many goals so it's going to be a really really difficult challenge for us They're a dangerous side but as we know if we can go out and deliver performances like we did at the weekend then you know hopefully that'll go a long way to to us getting the points that we want Last question from me about Joe Willick who has been missing um you've been following the concussion protocols Is he able to return to your squad tomorrow night yeah he's now exited the concussion protocols so he's available now to to be involved in the squad for tomorrow night Thanks Razer Keith Jason you said on um on Sunday after the match that Eddie I think he messaged you congratulations for how well you guys did Have you Have you been able to have um any more conversations about the performance or looking ahead to this game since then or is it has it been as basic a communication as that it's just been uh a few text messages uh yesterday Uh minimal contact really She said you know I think the most important thing for the manager now is to to rest and to recover Uh and probably not to sort of worry too much about anything other than making sure he's um he's recovered and he gets himself better as quickly as possible So I imagine the next couple of days if he's feeling better maybe we'll have a little bit more dialogue But as it stands as we are now you know there's been minimal contact And and you guys are like that with the players aren't you when when they're injured or they've had a spell away you kind of you ease them back in You don't sort of throw them back in the deep end I guess I guess for Eddie as well when he comes back and and you touching it there you want to make sure he's he's 100% because it's obviously a serious issue Of course I think you know when health is involved the most important thing is that you know uh that comes first and foremost above everything else And you know I'm sure when Eddie does return uh you know he will sort of probably ease himself in sort of to the role but it's important that when he does come back he's able to lead the team like he always does And you know hopefully that soon It's a dayby-day thing but you know he's in the best possible hands right now And you know as I say hopefully we can have him here as our leader uh as soon as possible but only when he's 100% right to do so In terms of the players we we saw on Sunday they're doing their their bit on the pitch Has there been any examples of of maybe what they're they're doing behind the scenes off the pitch to to step up and and obviously the leaders you've got a lot of leaders in that camp but just to take on that extra responsibility without Eddie being there No I think you know when been here sort of you know nearly four years now uh and the expectations and the demands that have been set on the players throughout that time day in day out they know the expectations they know the standards uh and with the group of players we got and the leadership we've got within the group uh you know it's down to everybody to maintain them standards we know that if we slack or slip away from the standards as it was set then we'll certainly get punished It's that type of league So uh they know the expectations Uh they they stood up and they was there to be counted against Manchester United They're going to have to do the same uh for the remaining games whether the manager is here or is not You know that's what we would expect from them Uh and you know I'm sure the type of group they are they'll go out and do that And this sort of fixture tomorrow against a team like Crystal Palace who as you rightly say have done well this season is kind of a similar sort of fixture to maybe something that you've maybe struggled in at times this season the likes of Bournemouth at home fulm at home Brighton in many ways Manchester United at home on Sunday kind of takes care of itself doesn't it you need to be aware that this is a a team that that can cause you problem It's certainly a team that can cause us problems and it's certainly a team that you know if we're not at our best will punish us and we know that and I'm sure the players know that They know the opportunity that lies in front of us uh Crystal Palace and you know we've got our own goals that we want to try and achieve and we know that everybody is aware of that Uh so as you say you know we the performances against Bournemouth at home and and Fulham at home was way below our standards and and we know that but since then we have we've you know we've been on a really good run We're a fantastic form Uh and it's important that we continue that and the only way we will do that is by being at our best and sticking to the standards that we've set ourselves uh for a long time now Thanks Keith Andy morning Jess Um we often in football kind of get lost in the football don't we and we get away from the humanistic side of things It's easy to forget Eddie's not just a colleague he's your mate How difficult has it been for you to see your mate unwell and in hospital over the last few days of course it's uh it's really difficult especially someone that you've worked so closely with for such a long time And as I said it you know he's never sort of missed more than a day or two in the whole time that we've been working together So it's a new situation for me Uh it's a new situation for for the players here at the football club and staff Uh so yeah but the most important thing and uh I think the thing that sort of almost gives you comfort is that he's in the best possible hands possible and um you know he's he's not a silly guy yet he'll sort of you know take notice of of what's said to him and he'll make sure that you know he's fully recovered when he comes back and the sooner he's back as I said before you know the best for everybody but only at a time when he feels he's ready to come back and is 100% to lead the team Absolutely Um on the football side there's a lot of talk about Newcast midfield Would you agree that it is one of the best around at the minute in the sort of balance that is there in the midfield with those three at the moment uh I would say they're they're certainly up there You know whether that's me myself being biased or not but you know you're talking three international players You know one is an Italian national and two Brazilian international So you know uh I think when you look at the caliber of countries that they sort of play for and the players that that they are uh they're certainly a tough uh opposition for for anybody to play against Uh they're in really good form They've got a really good understanding with each other strengths and weaknesses Uh and as we see from the weekend you know all three of them I thought was magnificent against Manchester United They're great characters They won't drop below their standards They're great leaders and we're going to need that leadership and quality for the remaining seven games On another note entirely a lot's been made about Dan Burn and his form recently in the amazing couple of months he's had I don't know if you'd seen but there was a clip during the rounds you probably have of him helping a guy move his car off a roundabout the way Does that sum up what sort of person he is after we've talked so much about what sort of player he is recently as well it does And I think no one in this building would be surprised with with that Uh you know Dan is such a level-headed lad Uh you know every single day he steps foot into the building and out on that pitch you know what he's going to deliver He's going to give you 100% commitment on the pitch off the pitch his attitude uh and he's always got time for people and he's always there to to give a helping hand wherever or whatever that may be And you know that was just uh you know great credit to Dan and his character Uh but no one was surprised because that's Dan Burn and he's got all the accolades and he's got all the rewards off the back of the fantastic attitude that he's got And just finally at it tomorrow night obviously it was an excellent day on Sunday How are Newcastle looking team news Obviously Anthony coming back onto the bench at the weekend How's he looking how's everyone else looking yeah everybody's uh come away from the game fine Uh as you said you know it was good to get Anthony Gordon some minutes on the pitch Great to have him back with the qualities that he's got Joe Willick's now back from see the concussion protocols Uh so the squad's in good shape Uh as always thankfully we didn't pick up any injuries from the weekend So we go into the Crystal Palace game uh you know full of health up to this moment obviously Thanks Jason Thanks Andy Alistister Hey Jason Can you give us an idea of how different your job has been daytoday how much more difficult maybe it's been with Eddie not here uh obviously the the media duties and commitments is probably the the thing that you're not used to and that takes up obviously more time Uh but in terms of the preparations and the day-to-day stuff we've worked together for so long We've worked in a in a way that we always have done So from that perspective it's no real different You obviously sort of prepare training and uh but obviously you haven't got the manager by your side with the experience and uh the help that that you would normally have Uh so it's been difficult from that perspective that now you're you've not got your leader there but everything else uh is is as it always has been and it has to be that way We have to keep things the same and the players understand that The players know that It's been an amazing season so far Do you feel a pressure to see this through and and meet those goals that you and Eddie will have had in the back of your minds at the start of the season are you managing to despite the circumstances enjoy this role and enjoy doing this there's always pressure on you know not just on myself but the players staff everybody to go and deliver the best they can for for the for the team and you're always under pressure to get results and that's no different Uh don't look at it that way you know the way we've always worked is to prepare the team the best way we possibly can to go out there deliver a performance good enough to get a result and that's what we'll continue to do Um in terms of my role as I said I'm just filling in for for the manager huge boots to fill as we know uh but you know with the experience of working together for so long I'm sure hopefully that will sort of help me but as I say uh we know the expectations and demands that we need to have to be able to go out there and deliver the right performances All right thank you Thank you Damian Spellelman in Mercer and George Cin please And Justin what would it mean to you to hand the reigns back to Eddie with the club in an even better position than when you took them up of course you know I think that's obviously what what I personally want to do and the rest of the staff and the players you know they want to go and deliver performances and results that the manager would would want and he would be proud of And you know that's our main goal and that's what we're working towards every single day Uh and hopefully we can do that As I say we've got a fantastic group of players great attitude great leaders Uh everybody stepped up against Man United Uh and everybody's going to need to step up and be at their best for for the remainder of the season Uh you asked about the midfield earlier When when you signed Sandro Tanali you obviously knew you were getting a very good technical player Did you realize the athlete you were getting obviously when a lot goes into signing signing players we certainly did uh from a football perspective We did a lot of research on on Sandro We loved him as a football player Technically uh you know tactically his age and athleticism Obviously we had all the stats to back that up Uh but it's only probably when you work with him so closely like we have done you realize what an exceptional talent he is And I think he's certainly showing everybody the quality player that he is and he's delivering fantastic performances right now And again you know he's he's a great lad as well with a fantastic attitude and uh you know he's a top top player Thank you Ian Good morning Jason Eddie's got a reputation in football as a workaholic invariably getting to work at dawn leaving after after dusk You know very very well Could you ever see the day when you managed in it in a in a different way maybe maybe a less demanding schedule or stepping back or will he or is he someone who always has to throw it all in 100% I think only he would be able to answer that question But you know knowing how we've worked for for so many years now that's that's the way Eddie has always been That's the manager he is And you know that's what's brought the success that that that's been there and that everybody uh has seen So I think he'll continue to be that way for as long as he's in management In my opinion I think you know he he won't want to work any other way Uh I think what times like this does it sort of does give you a little bit of a reality check sometimes to sort of maybe take stock and realize that you know your health is just as important or if not more important than than anything else Uh I imagine probably for the first maybe few weeks on returning back to work he'll you sort of bear that in mind and probably will will be a little bit more sensible But you know I'm sure once he's 100% recovered from his illness then you know he'll be the manager that he's always been Just just look at yourself Jason When when Eddie left Bournemouth uh you took over as permanent manager there eight months Was that something you always wanted or did your spell as the frontman convince you that your qualities were better served as as a coach and would you ever want to be a number one again no it's never been my intention And it's not what I wanted even at that time It wasn't and I think I made that clear Uh it was just at a time the circumstances as you know sort of the manager needed uh a break and wasn't sure whether he you know what his next chapter would be whether he'd come back into management or whether that would be it at that time Uh so the opportunity come sort of my way and it at that time it was an opportunity that I felt probably I I couldn't sort of turn down Uh but it's certainly not something that that I've got in mind that I want to do I'm happy in my role We've worked together for so long now and worked well and closely Uh and that's something that I want to continue to do Thanks We've got to George Dom Shaw and Lee Ryder please Morning Jason The team the team created kind of history again Manchester United which feels like a sort of weekly occurrence at the minute Was there any doubt at all in your mind that they would respond in the way that they did post Wembley to that sort of emotional outpouring and how have you gone about to ensure they did respond in this way obviously we you know it was important that we enjoyed the the cup final result uh you know because I think it's so difficult to to achieve success and to win trophies and we was able to do that due to the fixtures uh where we had a little bit of a break but then we also knew that we had some huge games coming up that we needed to make sure that we was right for to try and achieve our end goal uh and you know that was echoed by the manager uh and the players led by example and we've delivered some really good performances and I think obviously since the Brenford game on our return from from the break you know each performance has got better uh and I think you see that with the performance against Manchester United and I got to say with the way the lads have handled the situation and the way they trained last week testament to them they was excellent and we was really confident going into the Manchester United game off the back of last week's preparations and now we need to make sure we do the same for Palace Thank you And there were reports this morning that the club have agreed a deal for Antonio Cordiero a young Spanish player Is that something you know about or can offer any guidance on uh I know the the club's scaring Europe uh to try and find some you know some of the best talent that's out there Uh and I'm sure as soon as we have any more updates or news on that then you guys will be the the first to hear about it I'm sure Thanks George Dom Jason how important and supportive has Graeme been over the last week yeah Graeme's got great experience uh as we know And you know not just Graeme you got Steven Purchase I'm a Weatherstone you know all the sport science guys analysts So it's it's everybody and it's always been that way Uh we got fantastic staff at the football club and you know everybody's contributed everybody knows their roles and what's expected of them uh to to help the players go out there and deliver the best performance So we're very fortunate that we've got good people u around us and and everyone's played their part And is this the best version of Harvey Barnes you've seen since he joined the club uh certainly not surprised because you know when we signed Harvey Barnes we knew we were signing a a top player Uh and I think his history and his record at Leicester uh suggested that uh he's had to be really patient obviously with the form that Anthony Gordon was in uh but since he's coming to the team the last five games uh he's delivered some excellent team performances and individual performances and you know really really delighted for Harvey because he's such a great lad Thanks Tom Lee Ryder Jason is it fair to say there's no exact time frame for Eddie's return we know he's out for the the next two games but feels like there's no exact time frame No exact time frame You know that's something that will be assessed day by day and you know certainly uh not a question that I can answer is as we said he's in the best possible hands possible in the hospital and everything will be guided by by them and himself Uh and it'll just be a dayby-day thing So it feels like there's no pressure on him to come back at any stage before the season's done as as we've said uh he'll only come back when he's ready to come back and when he feels he's ready to come back under the guidance of the people that's taking care of him Just on Crystal Palace um was a 1-1 draw down there earlier in the season That was a tough game Um it feels like an even bigger game now at St James Park You can't underestimate the job that Glenn has done down there He's done a brilliant job You know they had a difficult start to the season Uh but you know their form of recent has been has been outstanding you know in the top sort of three or four I think it is in in the Premier League in some of their metrics So uh we know it's going to be a really really tough game for us They're a very dangerous side as I said earlier they've only lost two games in 15 I think it is away from home and obviously one of them was the weekend Uh so we know it's going to be a tough task and we know we have to be at our best to make sure that you know we get something from the game and you know with the group of players we've got they'll understand that they'll know that uh and hopefully we can go out and deliver a performance good enough to win the game Thanks Le We've got Jason Miller Jordan Cronin and Dom please Hi Jason Just given the serious nature of pneumonia and obviously the need for Eddie not to rush himself back are you ready to be in charge for all the final seven games this season as and when called upon As I said before it's you know it's a for me anyway it's a game by game uh dayby-day thing Uh you know I'm here to to step into to Ed's shoes uh as and when I need to That's that's my job That's what I have to do uh supported by the the excellent staff that we've got here at the football club So as I say you know hopefully the manager will be back uh as soon as possible sooner rather than later but only at a time when he feels ready and you know whenever that is uh it's my duties that I have to standing for him Are there any plans to visit him in hospital or would he not like with us at the right time uh but as I say you know he's uh in in good hands at the minute and you know he's being taken care of by by the best possible people Uh and I think you know at a time when he feels probably he's ready for for people to maybe go and see him then Uh then for sure I will do Yeah Thank you Thanks Jason Jordan hi Jason You first came across Woody United play a part in bringing him What was it back then that impressed you about Will just the the raw pace that he has Uh you know reminds me a lot of a young Callum Wilson Uh you know he's plays you runs in behind extremely well He's a goal scorer great size great athlete and he's got a fantastic attitude and obviously when you're as young as Will then you know you got huge potential And you know Willisu is developing really really well here And like a lot of players that we we sign at the football club certainly young players the likes of Lewis Hall and the Tino Momentos etc Uh they have to be patient and you know Will's getting a lot of work into him on the training ground and and I'm sure and we're all confident that when Will's moment and his opportunities come then he'll take him Mention how much has he developed since coming to coming to Newcastle yeah he he's developed uh really well Uh showing really really good signs of becoming a top player Uh and as I say you know when you're competing for a place you know alongside Alex Isaac is it's not easy One of the best strikers in Europe right now So uh he has to be patient as I said like everybody else And you when this opportunity comes I'm sure he'll take it Thanks Jordan We got to Dominic and finish with Kieran Kelly please Morning Jason Just to follow that up you mentioned the competition Willisula has with Alexander Isaak Calamos and potential further signings in the summer Is the what's the long-term plan for Willis could he go out on loan could he benefit from a loan spell moving forward that's something we know we have to sort of assess I say week by week month by month Uh you know we've got no plans to sort of send Will out alone He's you know he's an important part of the squad right now And then we know in football you know things can change very very quickly We've seen it time and time again uh throughout a managerial career not just here Uh as I said we said with the likes of Lewis all and Tino and young players especially they they probably do get a little bit impatient and frustrated at times but it's important that they stay grounded They keep working hard every single day Uh and the work they put in on the training ground will go a long way to them You know when they get the opportunity they take it and we'll the same And just on the injury front how's Sven Bachmann doing in his recovery i've been really pleased with Sven Bachmann's recovery He's is ahead of schedule He's uh he's now back out on the grass and you know hopefully he'll be back out there or back in contention very soon for us Thanks Tom Kira to finish Morning Jason Um can I just ask you you mentioned the demands expectations what does that look like dayto-day behind the scenes well there's a lot that goes into it There's obviously the preparation there's the tactical element there's the analysis element uh you know training uh so much stuff that that obviously goes into preparing the team to to go and deliver a performance And each game's different Each opposition's different They've got different strengths and weaknesses And it's our job to to make sure we try and sort of you know nullify their their strengths and exploit their weaknesses And uh but there's many ways to do that So um and that's what we're doing But as I said we've got really good staff around us that all contribute to to helping do that And finally do do you feel like hunters at the moment rather than hunted you know where you are at the table the teams above you that you're looking up rather than looking behind you Yeah you know we've always looked up because that's you know that's where we've always wanted to be and that's where we want to get to Uh but we know we have to be consistent and deliver performances week in week out Uh you know we've we've shown that consistent consistency recently uh which has put us in the position we're in But we can't take that for granted We can't uh step off the gas so to speak We know we got seven cup finals ourselves and we need to make sure that we go out there in every single game and perform the way we did against Manchester United with that effort commitment aggressiveness uh to go out there and help us get the results that we want to try and finish as high up the league as possible
